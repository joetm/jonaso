The text prompt

prompt:
eMoTioNaL dAmAGe, oil on canvas, trending on /r/art
The strength of the text conditioning (0 means don't condition on text, 1 means sample images that match the text about as well as the images match the text captions in the training set, 3+ is recommended).

weight:
2
Sample this many images.

n_images:
9
Specify the number of diffusion timesteps (default is 500, can lower for faster but lower quality sampling).

steps:
550
Set to 0 for deterministic (DDIM) sampling, 1 (the default) for stochastic (DDPM) sampling, and in between to interpolate between the two. 0 is preferred for low numbers of timesteps.

eta:
0.8
The random seed. Change this to sample different images.

seed:
346457
Display progress every this many timesteps.

display_every:
50
