    "description": {"__html": "<p>Text-to-image generation with deep generative models has made giant leaps towards becoming a mainstream phenomenon since OpenAI's introduction of the multimodal CLIP model in 2021. This explosion of interest was facilitated by the availability of executable notebooks on Google's Colaboratory in which non-expert users can execute machine learning models for free and without deep knowledge of programming. Users on Google Colab interact with generative models via input prompts. Prompts are short texts that describe the expected end result, such as \"a beautiful painting of a landscape\". The online community that quickly emerged around this novel way of synthesizing artworks found that the quality of the generated artworks can be increased by using so-called prompt modifiers in the input prompt, such as \"trending on artstation\" or \"rendered by Unreal Engine\". 'Prompt engineering' or 'prompting' refers to the practice and skill of finding effective input prompts for a text-to-image model.</p><p>This project investigates 1) the skill and practice of prompt engineering, 2) the emerging AI art community, and 3) the specific input prompts and modifiers used in this community.</p>"},

    "description": {"__html": "<p>Creativity is the process that leads to an artefact deemed both novel and useful in a given context and timeframe. Supporting creativity is considered as one of the grand challenges in HCI and inherently exploratory and transdisciplinary. Machines fall short in the fundamental characteristics that humans excel in — recombination, analogical transfer and divergent thinking. As machines cannot match the human intelligence when it comes to creativity, applying crowd-powered creativity support tools is an underexplored and promising area of research. As the World Wide Web has thoroughly permeated our work practices, supporting creative work with the crowd has become feasible. Microtasks are fast to complete, incur a low cognitive load and require little expertise. Crowdsourcing is especially effective in situations that require human cognition and judgement for optimal decision-making, such as creative work. Moreover, creativity is a social process. Studies from psychology show that groups of people with diverse backgrounds provide high quality ideas and can outperform skilled experts. Crowds offer this diverse set of skills because they are heterogeneous, providing different contexts and backgrounds leading to diverse ideas. Situated and mobile crowdsourcing further allows to tap into a local crowd with specialized knowledge.</p><p>This research project will explore challenges in regard to supporting creative work with the crowd. Of the eight creative activities suggested by Shneiderman, the majority of creativity support tools focus only on the ideation phase. This thesis aims to support a number of creative activities other than ideation, such as consulting with peers, dissemination, and searching. Some of the research questions investigated in this thesis are:<ul><li>Can structured judgements from non-experts support complex creative work?</li><li>How can the quality of crowdsourcing results be assessed?</li><li>What incentives could be given to crowdworkers to participate in creative tasks?</li><li>What is the best context conducive for supporting creative work?</li><li>What context do we need to provide in the tasks for the crowd (priming)?</li><li>What forms of collaboration are useful and helpful in crowd settings?</li><li>How will AI and human agents collaborate in complex creative tasks?</li></ul></p><p>We will address these questions using a systems development approach, validated in several use case studies. We will design, implement and evaluate a socio-technical system to support creative work with the crowd. We will deploy and evaluate this system on the campus of the University of Oulu. The system’s core will be a general purpose crowdsourcing platform that can support a variety of different tasks. While crowdsourcing platforms often are built for a specific purpose, we aim to create a solution that can support generic user-defined tasks, essentially forming a user-configurable social machine. One of the research questions will explore how and for what purpose users will use the system for.</p>"},

Its underlying consideration is that the ambiguous category of a discipline does not properly describes research. In fact, the description of interdisciplinary research is approximate only when taking into consideration the variety of specific actors and their connection to each other. Therefore, the so called «ID+Method» generates 11 relevant types of actors, different types of relations as well as rules of modeling. These models create differently compatible clusters of actors, and point out various possibilities and problems of relations - without a need of the discipline as a central category. Within the project, this method of modeling is transformed into a digital modeling tool: the «ID+App». Using the «ID+App», researchers without prior knowledge can model their own research contexts. Thereby, a record of the framework of knowledge production is being produced, contributing to the current debate about Open-Science by disclosing the practices of research. Furthermore, the scientist gains insight about his or her work through modeling: new connecting points are made explicit, showing further project development possibilities. The modeling tool is integrated into the «ID+Stage» - a platform for the publication of interdisciplinary research projects. Therein, various forms of publications should be enabled, which wouldn’t be usual in discipline-specific contexts. All those publications will be published together with their representative «ID+Modeling». Thus, the «ID+Publication» is to be understood not only as a result or an interim status but also as a meta-perspective disclosure of its formation process."},

What are the competitors’ strategies? What should be offered to the users? How to reach the critical mass of users?</i> The study was conducted in the form of an empirical survey (n=247), including an analysis of product features with a Conjoint Analysis. While we know today who won the race for the dominance of social networks (the winner takes all), the project's final presentation contains some important and interesting contemporary quotes and graphs from this exciting time of early social networks.</p>"},

    "description": {"__html": "<p>Zu den Grundaufgaben von Universitäten gehört die Lehre, und damit auch die Erstellung von Lernmaterialien und Vermittlung von Wissen. Im Zuge der sich verstärkenden Vernetzung und der mit dem Internet verbundenen Möglichkeiten wird der Einsatz digitaler Lehr- und Lernmaterialien an Bedeutung zunehmen. Um Inhalte digital verfügbar zu machen, bedarf es einer Interpretation der Lehrmaterialien. Erst durch die Beschreibung der Struktur und Bedeutung der Daten kann eine Weiterverarbeitung vorgenommen werden.</p><p>Ziel dieser Arbeit war die Entwicklung einer Beschreibungssprache für Wissen aus dem Bereich der Produktentwicklung (PE). Als Ausgangsbasis diente eine intensive Analyse der Inhaltsarten der Produktentwicklung. Die Inhalte der PE wurden klassifiziert und in ein allgemeingültiges Schema übersetzt. Die zu entwickelnde Beschreibungssprache sollte vor allem im Bereich der universitären Lehre zur Anwendung kommen. Jedoch sind auch andere Benutzergruppen denkbar, wie beispielsweise Produktentwickler in Unternehmen. Die Anforderungen, die sich aus dieser Zielsetzung ergeben, machen deutlich, dass ein modularer Aufbau der Inhaltseinheiten die bestmöglichen Resultate zeigt. Verteilt gespeicherte Einheiten erlauben nicht nur die einfache Aktualisierung von Inhalten, sondern auch die situationsbedingte Präsentation der Inhalte beim Benutzer in verschiedenen Formaten."},
