abstract = {Text-guided synthesis of images has made a giant leap towards becoming a mainstream phenomenon. With text-to-image generation systems, anybody can create digital images and artworks. This provokes the question of whether text-to-image generation is creative. This paper expounds on the nature of human creativity involved in text-to-image art (so-called “AI art”) with a specific focus on the practice of prompt engineering. The paper argues that the current product-centered view of creativity falls short in the context of text-to-image generation. A case exemplifying this shortcoming is provided and the importance of online communities for the creative ecosystem of text-to-image art is highlighted. The paper provides a high-level summary of this online ecosystem drawing on Rhodes’ conceptual four P model of creativity. Challenges for evaluating the creativity of text-to-image generation and opportunities for research on text-to-image generation in the field of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) are discussed.},

abstract = {Smart contracts are a method for implementing direct democracy in virtual worlds. However, it is not clear whether voting preferences in the virtual world will mirror real-world voting preferences. We present a within-subject study in which participants were asked to allocate voting power in two scenarios. The first scenario probed participants’ opinion about the divisibility of voting rights. The second scenario presented participants with the case of unequal allocation of voting power in a virtual world, enforced by smart contracts. In both scenarios, participants allocated voting power and rated the fairness of their decision. Our study finds that participants’ voting preferences in the virtual world scenario did not mirror their real-world preferences and beliefs. Voting systems in the metaverse need to be carefully designed to align with human values and ethics.},

abstract = {Crowdworkers silently enable much of today’s AI-based products, with several online platforms offering a myriad of data labelling and content moderation tasks through convenient labour marketplaces. The HCI community has been increasingly interested in investigating the worker-centric issues inherent in the current model and seeking for potential improvements that could be implemented in the future. This workshop explores how a reimagined perspective on crowdsourcing platforms could provide a more equitable, fair, and rewarding experience. This includes not only the workers but also the platforms, who could benefit e.g. from better processes for worker onboarding, skills-development, and growth. We invite visionary takes in various formats on this topic to spread awareness of worker-centric research and developments to the CHI community. As a result of interactive ideation work in the workshop, we articulate a future direction roadmap for research centred around crowdsourcing platforms. Finally, as a specific interest area, the workshop seeks to study crowdwork from the context of the Global South, which has been arising as an important but critically understudied crowdsourcing market in recent years.},

In this paper, we investigate how crowdsourced design feedback compares to peer design feedback within a design-oriented HCI class and across two metrics: perceived quality and perceived fairness. We also examine the perceived monetary value of crowdsourced feedback, which provides an interesting contrast to the typical requester-centric view of the value of labor on crowdsourcing platforms. Our results reveal that the students (N = 106) perceived the crowdsourced design feedback as inferior to peer design feedback in multiple ways. However, they also identified various positive aspects of the online crowds that peers cannot provide. We discuss the meaning of the findings and provide suggestions for teachers in HCI and other researchers interested in crowd feedback systems on using crowds as a potential complement to peers.},

Research on human scale spaces has focused mostly on the personal meaning or aesthetic and embodied experiences in the space. Further, spatial experience is increasingly topical in envisioning how to build and interact with technologies in our everyday lived environments, particularly in so-called smart cities. This workshop brings researchers and practitioners from diverse fields to collaboratively discover new ways to understand and capture human scale spatial experience and envision its implications to future technological and creative developments in our habitats. Using a speculative design approach, we sketch concrete solutions that could help to better capture critical features of human scale spaces and allow for unique possibilities for aspects such as urban play. As a result, we hope to contribute a road map for future HCI research on human scale spatial experience and its application.},
