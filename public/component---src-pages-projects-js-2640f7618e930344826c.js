Its underlying consideration is that the ambiguous category of a discipline does not properly describes research. In fact, the description of interdisciplinary research is approximate only when taking into consideration the variety of specific actors and their connection to each other. Therefore, the so called «ID+Method» generates 11 relevant types of actors, different types of relations as well as rules of modeling. These models create differently compatible clusters of actors, and point out various possibilities and problems of relations - without a need of the discipline as a central category. Within the project, this method of modeling is transformed into a digital modeling tool: the «ID+App». Using the «ID+App», researchers without prior knowledge can model their own research contexts. Thereby, a record of the framework of knowledge production is being produced, contributing to the current debate about Open-Science by disclosing the practices of research. Furthermore, the scientist gains insight about his or her work through modeling: new connecting points are made explicit, showing further project development possibilities. The modeling tool is integrated into the «ID+Stage» - a platform for the publication of interdisciplinary research projects. Therein, various forms of publications should be enabled, which wouldn’t be usual in discipline-specific contexts. All those publications will be published together with their representative «ID+Modeling». Thus, the «ID+Publication» is to be understood not only as a result or an interim status but also as a meta-perspective disclosure of its formation process."},description_old:{__html:"The Cluster of Excellence is a DFG-funded organization comprised of over 36 disciplines.
