Supporting creativity is considered as one of the grand challenges in HCI and inherently exploratory and transdisciplinary. Machines fall short in the fundamental characteristics that humans excel in — recombination, analogical transfer and divergent thinking. As machines cannot match the human intelligence when it comes to creativity, applying crowd-powered creativity support tools is an underexplored and promising area of research. As the World Wide Web has thoroughly permeated our work practices, supporting creative work with the crowd has become feasible. Microtasks are fast to complete, incur a low cognitive load and require little expertise. Crowdsourcing is especially effective in situations that require human cognition and judgement for optimal decision-making, such as creative work. Moreover, creativity is a social process. Studies from psychology show that groups of people with diverse backgrounds provide high quality ideas and can outperform skilled experts. Crowds offer this diverse set of skills because they are heterogeneous, providing different contexts and backgrounds leading to diverse ideas. Situated and mobile crowdsourcing further allows to tap into a local crowd with specialized knowledge.</p><p>This research project will explore challenges in regard to supporting creative work with the crowd. Of the eight creative activities suggested by Shneiderman, the majority of creativity support tools focus only on the ideation phase. This thesis aims to support a number of creative activities other than ideation, such as consulting with peers, dissemination, and searching. Some of the research questions investigated in this thesis are:<ul><li>Can structured judgements from non-experts support complex creative work?</li><li>How can the quality of crowdsourcing results be assessed?</li><li>What incentives could be given to crowdworkers to participate in creative tasks?</li><li>What is the best context conducive for supporting creative work?</li><li>What context do we need to provide in the tasks for the crowd (priming)?</li><li>What forms of collaboration are useful and helpful in crowd settings?</li><li>How will AI and human agents collaborate in complex creative tasks?</li></ul></p><p>We will address these questions using a systems development approach, validated in several use case studies. We will design, implement and evaluate a socio-technical system to support creative work with the crowd. We will deploy and evaluate this system on the campus of the University of Oulu. The system’s core will be a general purpose crowdsourcing platform that can support a variety of different tasks. While crowdsourcing platforms often are built for a specific purpose, we aim to create a solution that can support generic user-defined tasks, essentially forming a user-configurable social machine.

Its underlying consideration is that the ambiguous category of a discipline does not properly describes research. In fact, the description of interdisciplinary research is approximate only when taking into consideration the variety of specific actors and their connection to each other. Therefore, the so called «ID+Method» generates 11 relevant types of actors, different types of relations as well as rules of modeling. These models create differently compatible clusters of actors, and point out various possibilities and problems of relations - without a need of the discipline as a central category. Within the project, this method of modeling is transformed into a digital modeling tool: the «ID+App». Using the «ID+App», researchers without prior knowledge can model their own research contexts. Thereby, a record of the framework of knowledge production is being produced, contributing to the current debate about Open-Science by disclosing the practices of research. Furthermore, the scientist gains insight about his or her work through modeling: new connecting points are made explicit, showing further project development possibilities. The modeling tool is integrated into the «ID+Stage» - a platform for the publication of interdisciplinary research projects. Therein, various forms of publications should be enabled, which wouldn’t be usual in discipline-specific contexts. All those publications will be published together with their representative «ID+Modeling».

Via the provision of an interactive visualization of the interdisciplinary research activities, members of the cluster can explore relations concerning research topics, research objects, used methods, research activities and publications.</p><p>The project consists of three parts - a modelling method, a modelling application and an \'enhanced publication\' platform for the publication of interdisciplinary research projects. The underlying idea is that scientists can gain insights about their work through modelling: new connecting points are made explicit, showing further development possibilities for research projects and collaborations.</p>"},"funding":"","date":"2016","organisation":"Cluster of Excellency \\"Image Knowledge Gestaltung\\"","organisation_href":"https://www.interdisciplinary-laboratory.hu-berlin.de/de/content/idlab/","url":"https://www.interdisciplinary-laboratory.hu-berlin.de/en/content/idlab/","img":{"src":"/img/projects/idlab.jpg","alt":"","title":""},"publications":[]},{"id":"SP","title":"SkillsPlanner","lang":"en","description":{"__html":"<p>SkillsPlanner is a £1.3 million project envisioned to reduce the skills shortage in the UK’s construction industry. Partly funded by Innovate UK, the Open Data based platform aims to integrate and interpret data generated from sources provided by industry project partners in the UK such as Crossrail, Tideway and High Speed 2. The partners self-dependently upload their data into the CKAN storage. On upload, a series of tools executes the conversion into Linked Data and publishes selected data from the staging environment to the public server. The tools interact with the CKAN storage and the Linked Data platform via a RESTful API.</p><p>My role in this project was to self-responsibly develop the backend infrastructure and related data management and conversion tools.

Kano betrachtete drei Arten von Attributen (Basis-, Leistungs- und Begeisterungsfaktoren), die zur Zufriedenheit (oder Unzufriedenheit) mit einem Produkt beitragen. Die Attribute werden dabei aus Sicht eines einzelnen Kunden klassifiziert. Diese Klassifikation der Attribute kann sich von Person zu Person unterscheiden. Auch verändert sich die Wahrnehmung der Attribute bzw. Produktanforderungen im Laufe der Zeit. Man denke nur an das iPhone, dessen Charakteristiken bei der Ersteinführung in den Mobiltelefonmarkt Begeisterung hervorriefen, mittlerweile jedoch zum Standard geworden sind.</p><p>Unterstützt durch eine Literaturrecherche zum Kano-Modell wurde in dieser theoretischen Diplomarbeit untersucht, wie sich die Anforderungen der einzelnen Person an ein Produkt von den Anforderungen der gesamten Gesellschaft unterscheiden. Hierbei wurde die Gesellschaft als ein repräsentativer Nutzer modelliert. Durch systematische Variation und Diskussion der Produktanforderungen ergab sich eine Charakterisierung der gesellschaftlichen Produktanforderungen nach zeitlicher Stabilität, Universalität und Immaterialität des Anforderungsobjekts. Es konnte ausserdem gezeigt werden, dass sich gesellschaftliche Produktanforderungen im Kano-Modell nicht notwendigerweise spiegelverkehrt zu den Anforderungen der einzelnen Person verhalten.</p>"},"date":"2009","organisation":"Technische Universität Darmstadt","organisation_href":"https://www.tu-darmstadt.de/","url":null,"img":{"src":"/img/projects/kano-variation.jpg","alt":"","title":""},"presentations":[{"title":"Schematische Kurzzusammenfassung","year":2009,"conference":"Technische Universität Darmstadt","location":"Darmstadt, Germany","doi":null,"url":"/docs/diplomarbeit_poster.pdf","note":"Thesis poster."}],"publications":["kano2009"]},{"id":"P2P","title":"Business Concept for a Social Network based on Peer-to-Peer Technology","type":"studienarbeit","lang":"de","description":{"__html":"<p>Amidst the raging battle of the big social networks at the time (MySpace and Facebook), the KOM Multimedia Lab commissioned a student research project to investigate the possibilities for launching a new type of social network based on peer-to-peer technology.

Als Ausgangsbasis diente eine intensive Analyse der Inhaltsarten der Produktentwicklung. Die Inhalte der PE wurden klassifiziert und in ein allgemeingültiges Schema übersetzt. Die zu entwickelnde Beschreibungssprache sollte vor allem im Bereich der universitären Lehre zur Anwendung kommen. Jedoch sind auch andere Benutzergruppen denkbar, wie beispielsweise Produktentwickler in Unternehmen. Die Anforderungen, die sich aus dieser Zielsetzung ergeben, machen deutlich, dass ein modularer Aufbau der Inhaltseinheiten die bestmöglichen Resultate zeigt.
