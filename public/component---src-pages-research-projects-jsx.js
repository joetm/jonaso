Supporting creativity is considered as one of the grand challenges in HCI and inherently exploratory and transdisciplinary. Machines fall short in the fundamental characteristics that humans excel in ‚Äî recombination, analogical transfer and divergent thinking. As machines cannot match the human intelligence when it comes to creativity, applying crowd-powered creativity support tools is an underexplored and promising area of research. As the World Wide Web has thoroughly permeated our work practices, supporting creative work with the crowd has become feasible. Microtasks are fast to complete, incur a low cognitive load and require little expertise. Crowdsourcing is especially effective in situations that require human cognition and judgement for optimal decision-making, such as creative work. Moreover, creativity is a social process. Studies from psychology show that groups of people with diverse backgrounds provide high quality ideas and can outperform skilled experts. Crowds offer this diverse set of skills because they are heterogeneous, providing different contexts and backgrounds leading to diverse ideas. Situated and mobile crowdsourcing further allows to tap into a local crowd with specialized knowledge.</p><p>This research project will explore challenges in regard to supporting creative work with the crowd. Of the eight creative activities suggested by Shneiderman, the majority of creativity support tools focus only on the ideation phase. This thesis aims to support a number of creative activities other than ideation, such as consulting with peers, dissemination, and searching. Some of the research questions investigated in this thesis are:<ul><li>Can structured judgements from non-experts support complex creative work?</li><li>How can the quality of crowdsourcing results be assessed?</li><li>What incentives could be given to crowdworkers to participate in creative tasks?</li><li>What is the best context conducive for supporting creative work?</li><li>What context do we need to provide in the tasks for the crowd (priming)?</li><li>What forms of collaboration are useful and helpful in crowd settings?</li><li>How will AI and human agents collaborate in complex creative tasks?</li></ul></p><p>We will address these questions using a systems development approach, validated in several use case studies. We will design, implement and evaluate a socio-technical system to support creative work with the crowd. We will deploy and evaluate this system on the campus of the University of Oulu. The system‚Äôs core will be a general purpose crowdsourcing platform that can support a variety of different tasks. While crowdsourcing platforms often are built for a specific purpose, we aim to create a solution that can support generic user-defined tasks, essentially forming a user-configurable social machine.

In fact, the description of interdisciplinary research is approximate only when taking into consideration the variety of specific actors and their connection to each other. Therefore, the so called ¬´ID+Method¬ª generates 11 relevant types of actors, different types of relations as well as rules of modeling. These models create differently compatible clusters of actors, and point out various possibilities and problems of relations - without a need of the discipline as a central category. Within the project, this method of modeling is transformed into a digital modeling tool: the ¬´ID+App¬ª. Using the ¬´ID+App¬ª, researchers without prior knowledge can model their own research contexts. Thereby, a record of the framework of knowledge production is being produced, contributing to the current debate about Open-Science by disclosing the practices of research. Furthermore, the scientist gains insight about his or her work through modeling: new connecting points are made explicit, showing further project development possibilities. The modeling tool is integrated into the ¬´ID+Stage¬ª - a platform for the publication of interdisciplinary research projects. Therein, various forms of publications should be enabled, which wouldn‚Äôt be usual in discipline-specific contexts. All those publications will be published together with their representative ¬´ID+Modeling¬ª. Thus, the ¬´ID+Publication¬ª is to be understood not only as a result or an interim status but also as a meta-perspective disclosure of its formation process."},"description_old":{"__html":"The Cluster of Excellence is a DFG-funded organization comprised of over 36 disciplines.

Die Attribute werden dabei aus Sicht eines einzelnen Kunden klassifiziert. Diese Klassifikation der Attribute kann sich von Person zu Person unterscheiden.
