                "description": "The Natural History Museum in Berlin (Museum für Naturkunde - Leibniz Institute for Evolution and Biodiversity Science) is the largest of its kind in Germany and is among the top 10 world-wide. The museum is home to over 30 Mio. collection objects, more than 250 researchers and more than 400 research assistants, PhD students, from disciplines such as biology, palaeontology, mineralogy and information science.<br />Behind the publicly accessible spaces, these researchers work on manyfold projects in a multidisciplinary research setting. To bolster the MfN's efforts at ensuring knowledge transfer throughout its organisation, the HCC collaborates with the MfN in this BMBF-funded project to unveil the currently tacit knowledge, competencies, methods and research project information to the employees of the Museum. A formal ontology is developed to support the integration and enrichment of the research data with external knowledge sources or external knowledge repositories.<br />We aim to provide the researchers at MfN with (1) Wiki-based read and write access to internal information, (2) access to external scientific context for their research powered by linked data and (3) interactive visualisations of these networked sources of knowledge. Focussing on the seamless integration of these provisions, the HCC aims to set up an actionable and holistic system that visualises research project data and their potential for knowledge transfer in research museums like the Museum f&uuml; Naturkunde.",

For algorithms, this task is too complicated and for humans, it is too boring.<br />In this \"self-organised software project\", I supervised a group of students who developed a game that contributed to the valorisation of the collection of over 40,000 digitsed transparency slides of the Department of Art and Visual History of the Humboldt University of Berlin.",
