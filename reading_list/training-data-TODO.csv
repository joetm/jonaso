This is perhaps not surprising given that “When you invent the ship, you also invent the shipwreck ... Every technology carries its own negativity, which is invented at the same time as technical progress.” Indeed, many computing technologies follow this pattern, exhibiting a duality of “bright” and “dark” effects on people, firms, and societies. The problem is that the understanding of downsides of technology sometimes lags our understanding of upsides.

It is important to examine and discuss such trends given the lack of regulation of technology use and the limited awareness to possible technology use harms. By contrast with other harmful materials and behaviors (for example, using illicit substances, consuming junk food, not wearing seatbelts), the use of computing technologies is largely unregulated and many parents and children may not be aware of the extent of harm that may be associated with excessive use of technology.

Due to improvements in network defenses such techniques are recently gaining an increasing attention from actors like cybercriminals, terrorist and state-sponsored groups as they allow to store data or to cloak communication in a way that is not easily discoverble.

A number of articles suggested that al Qaeda members used steganography to coordinate their actions (2001). In these cases, information-hiding techniques were used to hide the confidential or illegal data into innocent-looking material, for example, digital pictures. Steganography is a well-known subfield of information hiding that aims is to cloak secret data in a suitable carrier. Since the time of Ancient Greece, over the Medieval Ages, to today’s world, information hiding has been often used to conceal messages on their way to a desired recipient.

Do these methods still protect data subjects against possible privacy harms associated with revealing sensitive and non-public information? Certainly, there is widespread skepticism about de-identification techniques among some leading privacy scholars and most of the popular press, which in turn undermines the credibility of the exemptions for de-identified data in regimes like HIPAA. This is of obvious concern because it not only creates legal and regulatory uncertainty for the scientific research community but may even discourage individuals from contributing data to new research F O R Y E A R S , T H E key ethic for safe, sustainable data sharing was anonymization. As long as a researcher or organization took steps to anonymize datasets, they could be freely used and shared. This notion was even embedded in law and policy. For example, laws like the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) Privacy Rule and the European Union’s Data Protection Directive facilitate sharing of anonymized datasets with fewer if any restrictions placed upon datasets that contain personal information. But it turns out that “anonymization” is not foolproof. The possibility of correctly identifying people and attributes from anonymized datasets has sparked one of the most lively and important debates in privacy law. In the past 20 years, researchers have shown that individuals can be identified in many different datasets once thought to have been fully protected by means of de-identification. In particular, a trio of well-known cases of re-identification has called into question the validity of the de-identification methods on which privacy law and policy, like the HIPAA privacy rule, relies. A governor and Netflix and AOL customers were all accurately identified from purportedly anonymized data. In each case, an adversary took advantage of auxiliary information to link an individual to a record in the deidentified dataset. The failure of anonymization has been widely publicized.

There has also been a mind shift from not just getting students into college but “increasingly, it’s ‘Okay, we got them in the door; let’s get them to succeed and get out on the other side,’” Morgan says. Also, the analytics tools have gotten better, so campus officials are becoming more knowledgeable about what it takes to help students, especially those at risk of dropping out. Although analytics in higher education is still in the early stages of implementation, 40% of CIOs say they will receive increased funding for it in 2019, according to Gartner research on the “Top 10 Business Trends Impacting Higher Education in 2019.” “More and more demand is being put on campuses to use analytics to improve student success ... because higher ed campuses are responsible or accountable to numbers of entities” such as accreditors, the federal government for financial aid, and their state for funding, notes Linda Baer, a senior consultant in higher education. Some states even use performancebased funding for higher education, says Baer. Another compelling reason: in addition to stakeholder accountability, the traditional student population is declining, she says. “One way to counter the [decline in] incoming enrollment is to improve retention and graduation rates, so people are focused on ‘how do we keep students staying here instead of dropping out?’’’ J ON RE ID ACKNOWLEDG ES he’s a bit of a procrastinator, and his study habits can be defined as “more loose and less structured.” So when the now-third-year senior learned during his freshman year about a personalized education tool being offered at his school, the University of Michigan (U-M), Reid was immediately on board. The second semester of Reid’s freshman year, he took a Statistics 250-level course, which he says is “notoriously difficult at Michigan.’’ Although Reid is a history major, he was required to take a quantitative reasoning class. “The first day I went into a lecture hall of maybe 300 students and I felt completely overwhelmed,’’ he recalls. “Math is not my strong suit.” Reid says the professor showed a quick tutorial on ECoach in the lecture hall, and students were even offered “a very small amount of extra credit to use it.” The concept of receiving personalized support with resources and a checklist of what to do before an exam was appealing because it’s “not my personality to go up to a professor.” ECoach helped Reid keep “everything fresh and centralized” and created a plan of attack for the class. “I felt I was staying ahead, and I was very confident going into the first exam.’’ The tool even sent Reid personalized feedback on how he did (he received an Aon the first exam), including the median grade, where he fell and some tips to improve his score. “I was very taken aback by that. I have never had a class where there was follow up on an exam with feedback and encouragement,’’ he says. ECoach is the brainchild of U-M professor Timothy McKay, who began looking at student data in his large Introduction to Physics classes in 2008, trying to understand who was succeeding and who was struggling. “Looking at the data made me recognize the differences in backgrounds and goals, and the reasons for taking physics and the affect toward it,’’ McKay says. Some students were enthusiastic and some were terrified, he says. “I found myself wanting to be speaking differently to every one of my students,” McKay says, “and do that in a way that was informed by who they are, where they’re coming from and their trajectory; all things you’d like to know in order to coach them effectively.” ECoach is designed for first-year students taking science, technology, engineering, or mathematics (STEM) classes, who can access the ECoach website with a single sign-on. The personalization ECoach offers is based on data the university already has, such as what courses a student has taken, what their grades have been, and information from their admissions application, “so we can note what their high school background was and their standardized testing” scores, according to McKay. Students are also asked questions, such as whether they are frightened about taking a particular class. If so, “it’s important that we talk to them and let them know if they work with us and follow the advice [in ECoach], they can be successful,” McKay says.')","('authors', [])","('filename', '!3381910.pdf')","('title', '')"

As a computer scientist, I am convinced we need the concept of computational thinking, interpreted as “being able to think like a computer scientist and being able to apply this competence to every field of human endeavor.” The focus of this Viewpoint is to discuss to what extent we need the expression “computational thinking” (CT). The term was already known through the work of Seymour Papert, many computational scientists,5 and a recent paper15 clarifies both its historical development and intellectual roots. After the widely cited Communications Viewpoint by Jeannette Wing, and thanks to her role at NSF,6 an extensive discussion opened with hundreds of subsequent papers dissecting the expression. There is not yet a commonly agreed definition of CT—what I consider in this Viewpoint is whether we really need a definition and for which goal. To anticipate the conclusion, we probably need the expression as an instrument, as a shorthand reference to a well-structured concept, but it might be dangerous to insist too much on it and to try to precisely characterize it. It should serve just as a brief explanation of why computer science (or informatics, or computing: I will use these terms interchangeably) is a novel and independent scientific subject and to argue for the need of teaching informatics in schools. Wing discussed CT to argue it is important every student is taught “how a computer scientist thinks,” which I interpret to mean it is important to teach computer science to every student. From this perspective, what is important is stressing the educational value of informatics for all students— Wing was in line with what other wellknown scientists had said earlier; I mention several here.

Computational methods and models give us the courage to solve problems and design systems that no one of us would be capable of tackling alone. Computational thinking confronts the riddle of machine intelligence: What can humans do better than computers? and What can computers do better than humans? Most fundamentally it addresses the question: What is computable? Today, we know only parts of the answers to such questions. Computational thinking is a fundamental skill for everyone, not just for computer scientists. To reading, writing, and arithmetic, we should add computational thinking to every child’s analytical ability. Just as the printing press facilitated the spread of the three Rs, what is appropriately incestuous about this vision is that computing and computers facilitate the spread of computational thinking. Computational thinking involves solving problems, designing systems, and understanding human behavior, by drawing on the concepts fundamental to computer science. Computational thinking includes a range of mental tools that reflect the breadth of the field of computer science. Having to solve a particular problem, we might ask: How difficult is it to solve? and What’s the best way to solve it? Computer science rests on solid theoretical underpinnings to answer such questions precisely. Stating the difficulty of a problem accounts for the underlying power of the machine—the computing device that will run the solution. We must consider the machine’s instruction set, its resource constraints, and its operating environment. In solving a problem efficiently, we might further ask whether an approximate solution is good enough, whether we can use randomization to our advantage, and whether false positives or false negatives are allowed. Computational thinking is reformulating a seemingly difficult problem into one we know how to solve, perhaps by reduction, embedding, transformation, or simulation. Computational thinking is thinking recursively. It is parallel processing. It is interpreting code as data and data as code. It is type checking as the generalization of dimensional analysis. It is recognizing both the virtues and the dangers of aliasing, or giving someone or something more than one name. It is recognizing both the cost and power of indirect addressing and procedure call. It is judging a program not just for correctness and efficiency but for aesthetics, and a system’s design for simplicity and elegance. Computational thinking is using abstraction and decomposition when attacking a large complex task or designing a large complex system. It is separation of concerns. It is choosing an appropriate representation for a problem or modeling the relevant aspects of a problem to make it tractable. It is using invariants to describe a system’s behavior succinctly and declaratively. It is having the confidence we can safely use, modify, and influence a large complex system without understanding its every detail. It is LI A H A N EY Viewpoint Jeannette M.

Learners have the capacity to develop computational products that can have authentic impact in their lives from the moment they begin learning to code, all they need is to be situated in contexts that allow them to do so.

Even more progressive CS education that centers around the development of learners’ computational thinking has largely focused on learners understanding the nuanced elements of computation, such as variables, loops, conditionals, parallelism, operators, and data handling. This initial focus on the concepts and processes of computing, leaving realworld applications for “later” runs the risk of making learners feel that computing is not important for them to learn. It begs the question far too many math or physics students have asked, “When will we use this in our lives?” While there have been attempts to situate computing education in realworld contexts and problems, they are often generic (for example, designing checkout systems for supermarkets) and fail to connect to the specific personal interests and lives of learners.

By 2020, 67% of enterprise IT infrastructure and software spending will be for cloud-based offerings.16 A major factor in the increased adoption of the cloud by enterprise IT was its pay-as-you-go model where a customer pays only for resources leased from the cloud provider and have the ability to get as many resources as needed with no up-front cost (elasticity).2 Unfortunately, the burden of scaling was left for developers and system designers that typically used overprovisioning techniques to handle sudden surges in service requests. Studies of reported usage of cloud resources in datacenters19 show a substantial gap between the resources that cloud customers allocate and pay for (leasing VMs), and actual resource utilization (CPU, memory, and so on). Serverless computing is emerging as a new and compelling paradigm for the deployment of cloud applications, largely due to the recent shift of enterprise application architectures to containers and microservices. Using serverless gives pay-asyou-go without additional work to start and stop server and is closer to original expectations for cloud computing to be treated like as a utility. Developers using serverless computing can get cost savings and scalability without needing to havea high level of cloud computing expertise that is time-consuming to acquire. Due to its simplicity and economical advantages, serverless computing is gaining popularity as reported by the increasing rate of the “serverless” search term by Google Trends.

As we move toward the next-generation Web platform, the bulk of user data and applications will reside in the network cloud. Ubiquitous access results from interaction delivered as Web pages augmented by JavaScript to create highly reactive user interfaces. This point in the evolution of the Web is often called Web 2.0. In predicting what comes after Web 2.0—what I call 2W, a Web that encompasses all Web-addressable information—I go back to the architectural foundations of the Web, analyze the move to Web 2.0, and look forward to what might follow. For most users of the Internet, the Web is epitomized by the browser, the program they use to log on to the Web. However, in its essence, the Web, which is both a lot more and a lot less than the browser, is built on three components: URL. A universal means for identifying and addressing content6,7; HTTP. A protocol for client-server communication; and HTML. A simple markup language for communicating hypertext content. Together, they constitute the global hypertext system. This decentralized architecture was designed from the outset to create an environment where content producers and consumers come together without everyone having to use the same server and client. To participate in the Web revolution, one needed only to subscribe to the basic architecture of Web content delivered via HTTP and addressable via URLs. This yielded the now well-understood network effect that continues to produce exponential growth in the amount of available Web content. In the 1990s, the browser, a universal lens for viewing the Web, came to occupy center stage as the Web’s primary interface. Deploying content to users on multiple platforms was suddenly a lot simpler; all one needed to enable universal access was to publish content to the Web. Note that this access was a direct consequence (by design) of the underlying Web contract, whereby Web publishers are isolated from the details of the client software used by their consumers. As Web browsers began to compete on features, this began to change in what became known as the browser wars, 1995–1999; browser vendors competed by introducing custom tags into their particular flavors of HTML. This was perhaps the first of the many battles that would follow and is remembered today by most Web developers as the blink and marquee tag era marked by visual excess. In 1997, HTML 3.2 attempted to ease the life of Web developers by documenting the existing authoring practice of the time. HTML 3.2 was in turn followed by HTML4 as a baseline markup language for the Web.

The Marea cable has enough capacity to “stream 71 million high-definition videos simultaneously,” according to the company. Despite this ongoing change in cable dominance, undersea cables often force traditional telecoms and the new guard of tech giants to play nice. The Marea cable is the result of a partnership between Microsoft, Facebook, Amazon, and Telxius, a spinoff that manages telecom infrastructure for multinational telecom Telefonica. That is because advanced cables like Marea are critical to meeting rising demand from the consumers and businesses both telecoms and tech giants serve. “Marea comes at a critical time,” says Microsoft president Brad Smith. “Submarine cables in the Atlantic already carry 55% more data than transPacific routes, and 40% more data than between the U.S. and Latin U NDERSEA CABLES ARE responsible for moving data between countries and continents at high speeds, making everything from photo sharing to financial transactions possible.

Given the sheer scope of undersea cables, which often span entire oceans, The New York Times estimates an individual undersea cable project can cost up to $350 million. That is why these cables have historically been laid by global telecommunications firms with the deep pockets and technical expertise necessary to undertake these projects. However, tech companies are increasingly dominating both the use and implementation of undersea cables. “Some of the main investors in new cables now are Google and Facebook,” says Alan Maudlin, research director at TeleGeography, a telecommunications research firm, because tech giants are increasingly the ones using all that undersea bandwidth. When it comes to global bandwidth usage, just a handful of services account for more than a third of all bandwidth, according to research from network intelligence company Sandvine. The company’s Global Intenet Phenomena Report identifies Web-based media streaming, Netflix, and YouTube as the top three users of global traffic, comprising 34.1% of traffic as of September 2019.

The primary goal of WebAssembly is (currently) not to replace JavaScript, but to complement it by making it easier to develop computationally demanding Web applications, such as games, software for audio/video processing, virtual reality systems, and CAD tools, as well as to port desktop applications to the Web. This is just the first step. The initial focus of the WebAssembly team has been on compilation from C/C++, and the first major milestone has been reached. The future work will likely concentrate on extending WebAssembly with support for parallel execution, and beyond that memory management with garbage collection, which will simplify compilation from many high-level programming languages, for example, Java, C#, Swift, and OCaml. Although specifically designed with browser-based execution in mind, despite the name, there is actually not much “Web”specific in WebAssembly. Perhaps the “write once, run anywhere” slogan once used by Java will be resurrected with WebAssembly?')","('authors', [])","('filename', '-p106-moller.pdf')","('title', '')"

Any remedy for bias must start with awareness that bias exists; for example, most mature societies raise awareness of social bias through affirmative-action programs, and, while awareness alone does not completely alleviate the problem, it helps guide us toward a solution. Bias on the Web reflects both societal and internal biases within ourselves, emerging in subtler ways. This article aims to increase awareness of the potential effects imposed on us all through bias present in Web use and content. We must thus consider and account for it in the design of Web systems that truly address people’s needs. Bias has been intrinsically embedded in culture and history since the beginning of time. However, due to the rise of digital data, it can now spread faster than ever and reach many more people. This has caused bias in big data to become a trending and controversial topic in recent years. Minorities, especially, have felt the harmful effects of data bias when pursuing life goals, with outcomes governed primarily by algorithms, from mortgage loans to advertising personalization. While the obstacles they face remain an important roadblock, bias affects us all, though much of the time we are unaware it exists or how it might (negatively) influence our judgment and behavior. The Web is today’s most prominent communication channel, as well as a place where our biases converge. As social media are increasingly central to daily life, they expose us to influencers we might not have encountered previously. This makes understanding and recognizing bias on the Web more essential than ever. My main goal here is thus to raise the awareness level for all Web biases.

This pressure comes from the general public, civil society, and government institutions. In parallel is a growing recognition that current ethics review procedures within ICT may not address broader concerns (such as the potential societal consequences of innovation). Instances of ICT raising concerns abound. For example, along with attention-grabbing headlines that artificial intelligence (AI) could ultimately pose an existential threat to humankind, there are more prosaic, yet strongly felt, social transformations already associated with AI technologies. For example, AI is an increasingly powerful protagonist in the story of how digital technologies are transforming the nature of work, as more types of work are mediated digitally, including how it is allocated, assessed, and rewarded. With these new forms of digital agency driving important aspects of labor markets, questions arise as to whose interests are being served and how accountability and transparency can be assured. This is but one example of many debates around technology-, product-, and process-based innovation. Potential conflicts are wide-ranging and, most important, often emerge only after technologies have been embedded into the mainstream. ICT scholars and professionals have long tried to understand and address these issues, though there are still numerous areas of concern. A novel concept—“responsible research and innovation,” or RRI —has emerged recently in response to the challenge of designing innovations in a socially desirable and acceptable way. It may be useful for framing the discussion about how to manage the introduction of future innovations in ICT. In this article, we discuss the origins of RRI, consider relevant research from computer ethics and human-computer interaction (HCI), and illustrate the need for a new approach for the governance of ICT research. Finally, we suggest ways researchers might draw upon a framework for RRI in ICT based on the findings of an interview study conducted Responsible Research and Innovation in the Digital Age DOI:10.1145/3064940')","('authors', [{'name': 'MARK HARTSWOOD', 'affiliations': []}])","('filename', '!p62-jirotka.pdf')","('title', '')"

But information freedom meant that rather than creating an information market, information has become “commons,” an unregulated shared public resource, which, as popularized by Garrett Hardin in an influential 1968 article, is subject to “The Tragedy of the Commons.” This phrase refers to the phenomenon where individual users acting independently according to their own self-interest behave contrary to the common good. Of course, we all love free information. The question is whether information freedom is good for society. But markets in which the prices for goods and services are determined by sellers and buyers are among the greatest inventions of human civilization, though arguments continue about the relative advantages and disadvantages of free markets, coordinated markets, regulated markets, and the like. Regardless of the details, markets provide us with a mechanism for finding the value of goods and services. Communism is the most famous 20-century attempt to build market-free economies. It required coercion on a colossal scale, with an incalculable cost in human lives. The Internet is the second major attempt to build a market-free economy, limited to information.

To understand where this Internet comes from, we have to revisit the emergence of online communities in the early and mid-1980s. Consider, for example, the WELL, which began in 1985 as a dial-up bulletin board system, self-described as “a cherished watering hole for articulate and playful thinkers.” One of its founders was Stewart Brand, best known as editor of the Whole Earth Catalog, an American counterculture magazine and product catalog published periodically since the late 1960s. “Counterculture” refers to a late1960s–early-1970s Western antiestablishment cultural movement, whose members were known as “hippies.” Today’s Internet, with its techno-utopian culture, connects with the 1960s counterculture movement. In a 1984 Hackers’ Conference, Brand told Steve Wozniak, a founder of Apple Inc., “Information wants to be free, because the cost of getting it out is getting lower and lower all the time.” This phrase, “Information wants to free,” came to mean people should be able to access information freely.

Eisen, a molecular biologist at the University of California, Berkeley, argues that scientists can get much better value by publishing in open-access journals, which make articles free for everyone to read and which recoup their costs by charging authors or funders. Among the best-known examples are journals published by the Public Library of Science (PLoS), which Eisen co-founded in 2000. “The costs of research publishing can be much lower than people think,” agrees Peter Binfield, co-founder of one of the newest open-access journals, PeerJ, and formerly a publisher at PLoS.

We describe requirements that we believe any such mechanisms must satisfy and we discuss the importance of defining a compact set of intergrid protocols to enable interoperability among different Grid systems.

Networks of research collaboration are expanding in every region of the globe. The established science superpowers of the United States and Europe have dominated the research world since 1945. Yet this Atlantic axis is unlikely to be the main focus of research by 2045, or perhaps even by 2020. New regional networks are reinforcing the competence and capacity of emerging research economies, and changing the global balance of research activity. This may well reveal different ways of approaching challenges, and solutions that are different to those of Western institutions. If the science superpowers are to avoid being left behind, they will need to step out of their comfort zones to keep up with the dynamism of the new players in this shifting landscape. Collaboration is normally a good thing from a wider public perspective. Knowledge is better transferred and combined by collaboration, and co-authored papers tend to be cited more frequently. But could increased global collaboration mean a blending of objectives that risks leaving bland priorities? Co-authorship is a valid proxy for collaboration because few scientists surrender credit for their papers lightly, so we can assume that sharing of authorship reflects a tangible engagement. Such publication data are readily available, cover many countries and research disciplines to a good depth, and have reasonable consistency across decades. Changes in the balance of research done by the lone scientist and that done by teams can be seen in co-authorship data. Coauthorship has been increasing inexorably. Recently it has exploded. An issue of Nature today has a similar number of Letters to one from 60 years ago, but at least four times more authors. Similar observations have been documented from clinical science to law. In the early 1980s, papers with more than 100 authors were rare. By 1990, the annual tally with that number exceeded 500 — and it has kept growing. The first paper with 1,000 authors was published in 2004; a paper with 3,000 authors came in 2008. By last year, a total of 120 physics papers had more than 1,000 authors and 44 had more than 3,000 (ref. 6). Many of these are from collaborations at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN, Europe’s particlephysics lab near Geneva, Switzerland. This upwards trend in multi-authorship will continue through shared global priorities in health, energy, climate and social structures, propelled in part by international agencies such as the World Health Organization. Some of this growth will not be true collaboration but will come from independent contributions to joint efforts, usually in the form of data, that involve only weak intellectual interaction.')","('authors', [])","('filename', '!490335a.pdf')","('title', '')"

Recently, a change of the second sort occurred that altered our perception of the workings of science itself. A study of more than 21 million papers published worldwide from 1945 to the present reveals a fundamental and nearly universal shift in all branches of science: Teams increasingly dominate solo scientists in the production of high-impact, highly cited science; teams are growing in size; and teams are increasingly located across university boundaries rather than within them (1). Similar patterns were found for all the patents published worldwide (2). Speculation as to why this shift occurred centers on the nature of the problems increasingly studied: complex problems that cut across disciplinary areas and require multiple divergent perspectives. Cross-disciplinary teams, whether utilizing approaches that are multidisciplinary (in which experts from different scientific fields collaborate yet reside in their topic areas), interdisciplinary (results and expertise from two or more scientific fields are combined), or transdisciplinary (disciplinary boundaries are crossed to create a holistic approach) (3) are expected to hold the key to success. More specifically, “team science” is expected to combine specialized expertise, theoretical approaches, and research methods across disciplinary boundaries, solving these complex problems and producing high-impact science. In order to realize the unprecedented opportunities posed by team science, we need to develop new means to recruit, retain, and empower scientists from many different fields to work together, support the tenure and careers of younger scholars working across disciplines, and sustain funding for highly interdisciplinary research (4). In fact, funding agencies, academic research institutions, and private sector organizations across the nation recognize the need to support team science. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) funds several interand transdisciplinary research centers on cancer, health disparities, and other topics. In addition, the NIH’s National Center for Research Resources funds the Clinical and Translational Science Awards (CTSAs) that have as a major goal “... to develop teams of investigators from various fields of research who can take scientific discoveries in the laboratory and turn them into treatments and strategies for patients in the clinic” (5). The National Science Foundation invites projects on Cyber-Enabled Discovery and Innovation that place an “emphasis on bold multidisciplinary activities that, through computational thinking, promise radical, paradigm-changing research findings.” The MacArthur, Robert Wood Johnson, and W.T. Grant Foundations all support interdisciplinary research networks. The National Academies’ KECK Futures Initiative promotes interdisciplinary research related to science, engineering, and medicine. At the same time, according to a White House memorandum, funding agencies, academic leadership, and industry must manage their portfolios in an objective, evidence-based manner to address science and technology priorities of our nation and increase the productivity of our research institutions (6).

There are simple and effective randomized algorithms that can create summaries that allow the estimation of the final weight of a given item to a high degree of accuracy. However, when there are a very large number of possible items to consider (say, the combination of every tweet and every page on the Web), making the search process efficient becomes the chief objective. Consequently, the main focus of the following paper is on building up sufficient information to allow a more effective search process. It proceeds by incrementally developing the solution from first principles, relying on concepts from across computer science: randomly partitioning the input space to simplify the core problem; modifying the encoding of the item identifiers, and applying ideas from coding theory to correct for noise; using a construction based on expander graphs to make this more robust; and finally making use of an approach to clustering from spectral graph theory to ensure the identifiers of the heavy hitters can be correctly extracted. The end result is an algorithm that, for the first time, meets the minimum space cost to solve the problem while giving an efficient search time cost. This opens the way for further work. How efficiently could this clustering approach be implemented in practice, and what applications might it find elsewhere? While identifying popular items is a foundational question for data analysis, there are many more questions that can be asked.

Progress in cognitive science and human-computer interaction is moving toward a coherent set of theories and models to address the complexity of modern-day information seeking at a range of scales, from the long-term social to individual moment-by-moment interaction. The second opportunity expands the kinds of things we study and develop.

The information environment has become a place to explore and learn over longer periods. It has become much more social. People use many tools and systems fluidly for many purposes.

This contrasts with a typical database application that involves very structured data, such as employee records. The notion of structure being used here is not only that the data conforms to a format such as a record type description, but also that the fields of the records consist of simple data types with well-defined meanings.

This suggests they don’t really know what might be useful for them, and therefore may not be able to specify the salient characteristics of potentially useful information objects. Unfortunately, typical information systems require users to specify what they want the system to retrieve. Furthermore, people engaging in large-scale information systems typically are unfamiliar with the underlying operations of the systems, the vocabularies the systems use to describe the information objects in their databases, and even the nature of the databases themselves. This situation suggests it might be appropriate for some part of the information system to recommend courses of action to information seekers, which could help them to better understand their problems, and to use the system’s resources more effectively. This is the general challenge our research group at Rutgers has been addressing over the last several years [2, 4]. One specific aspect of the difficulties people face in interacting in information systems is choosing the correct words to represent their information problems.

Designing a substantial ontology is not trivial, and designing it so it has relevance and value to a broad audience is even more challenging. Generally, ontology is a branch of philosophy dealing with the order and structure of reality. Here, we adopt Gruber’s view that an ontology is an explicit specification of an abstract, simplified view of a world we desire to represent [2]. It specifies both the concepts inherent in this view and their interrelationships. A typical reason for constructing an ontology is to give a common language for sharing and reusing knowledge about phenomena in the world of interest. For instance, an ontology for knowledge-based organizations would furnish terms and definitions for concepts (entities, objects, events, processes, goals, and results) deemed to be important in characterizing these organizations at a desired level of detail; concepts and their relationships would be further characterized in terms of axioms and constraints that may be expressed more or less formally. Among those who adopt the ontology, its terms are used in asking and answering questions, making assertions, offering insights, describing practices, and discussing investigations pertaining to the conduct of knowledge management (KM). In building and applying an ontology, it is important to clearly make the following distinction: on one hand, there is the ontology itself, which specifies concepts used in a domain of endeavor, concepts whose existence and relationships are true by definition or convention. On the other hand, there are empirical facts about these concepts and relationships. They are not part of the ontology, although they are structured by it. They are subject to context, observation, testing, evaluation, or modification.

How is it possible to know there is more information, outside of what the system can access, that affects the interpretation of data? The solution to the context problem in practice today is a pragmatic, engineering one: analyze errors (in recommendations, question answers, image recognition, etc.), classify the kinds of contextual information that caused the wrong behavior, find the most common type of context that causes errors, and add information about that kind of context to the system. Clearly this approach is neither general nor scalable, and ignores the infamous long tail of possible contextual information that may affect a system’s understanding and its behavior. In this position paper we will outline a new, more general, approach to recognizing context. The approach is grounded in a fairly simple intuition: the mathematics underlying quantum mechanics is far more appropriate for modeling, and therefore simulating, human cognitive behavior than the standard toolset from classical statistics.

In that sense, the Web of data is increasingly used to help humans in their daily lives. In contrast, crowdsourcing leverages a Web of documents, made for humans, to help machines solve computationally complex tasks. Crowdsourcing and the Semantic Web were in that sense bound to meet each other, and to come together to solve some of the most formidable open problems in information management. In my research group, the eXascale Infolab1 both topics frequently support each other. On one hand, we recently used crowdsourcing to help solve complex Semantic Web issues such as entity linking [1] or instance matching [2]. Semantic data, on the other hand, was instrumental in facilitating advances in push crowdsourcing [3] and in crowdsourced data sensing [4]. Another interesting convergence might occur in a few years, when generalized micro-task crowdsourcing platforms will emerge and host arbitrary complex tasks—some annotated using Semantic Web information.

While the proponents of the Web were driven by similar values, there is now increasing concern in Europe—and beyond—that the Web has become a vehicle of disintegration, polarization, and exploitation. What is more, since the Web operates at a global scale, beyond nation-states and with little formal regulation, we lack both the understanding and the means to avoid sleepwalking into another catastrophe. Web Science seeks to investigate, analyze, and intervene in the Web from a sociotechnical perspective, integrating our understanding of the mathematical properties, engineering principles, and the social processes that shape its past, present, and future. Over the past 10 years, Web Science has made remarkable progress, providing the building blocks to face the challenges described here. And yet there is more do to. In this article, we offer a more detailed definition of Web Science and outline its achievements to date. We consider how Web Science frames and addresses key sociotechnical challenges facing the Web now and for the near future, emphasizing the importance of this as new artificial intelligences start to shape the Web (and Web Science) in significant new directions. Arising from this, we outline some of the practical strategies Web Science is developing to integrate knowledge across disciplinary boundaries and build collaboration with Web stakeholders.

Their study has been the subject of Network Science research for a number of years. However, more recently we have witnessed the emergence of two new interdisciplinary areas: Web Science and Internet Science. Network Science can be traced to its mathematical origins dating back to Leonard Euler’s seminal work on graph theory in the 18th century and to its social scientific origins two centuries later by the psychiatrist Jacob Moreno’s25 efforts to develop “sociometry.” Soon thereafter, the mathematical framework offered by graph theory was also picked up by psychologists, anthropologists,23 and other social scientists to create an interdiscipline called Social Networks. The interdiscipline of Social Networks expanded even further toward the end of the 20 century with an explosion of interest in exploring networks in biological, physical, and technological systems. The term Network Science emerged as an interdisciplinary area that draws on disciplines such as physics, mathematics, computer science, biology, economics, and sociology to encompass networks that were not necessarily social. The study of networks involves developing explanatory models to understand the emergence of networks, building predictive models to anticipate the evolution of networks, and constructing prescriptive models to optimize the outcomes of networks. One of the main tenets of Network Science is to identify common underpinning principles and laws that apply across very different networks and explore why in some cases those patterns vary. The Internet and the Web, given their spectacular growth and impact, are networks that have captured the imagination of many network scientists.

Although neoclassical economic theory predicts that buyers (that is, authors in OA publishing) pay nothing if T HE OPE N ACCESS publishing movement has received strong support from scientists, lawmakers, and funding institutions. Many publishers are reacting to this demand by offering open access journals. However, there is an ongoing debate on how open access publishing models should be financed. Most open access journals that rely on the so-called “gold open access model”—which makes the research output immediately available from the publisher—let authors of accepted papers pay article processing charges (APCs) of several hundred to several thousand U.S. dollars. However, APCs are often criticized for potentially excluding researchers with limited funds. As one potential solution to this problem and also to gain a better understanding of the role of APCs in the scientific community, some publishers are starting to use Pay What You Want (PWYW) as a pricing model for gold open access publishing. PWYW is a pricing model where sellers delegate the full pricing power to buyers. So far, PWYW has mainly been applied in service industries (for example, restaurants, theaters), but also for the sale of digital products like software (such as http://humblebundle.com). More recently, several publishers of open access journals like Cogent OA (belonging to the Taylor & Francis Group), edp Sciences, and Thieme Publishers have started to experiment with the PWYW model for APCs of open access journals. More specifically, Cogent OA empowers authors to decide how much they want to pay for their open access publication in 15 broad journals covering different domains of academic research.

Shortly after, the human era will be ended. Is such progress avoidable? If not to be avoided, can events be guided so that we may survive? These questions are investigated. Some possible answers (and some further dangers) are presented. II PI_m_aDH\'_ PAE_ I_L.ANK _{JT FILMBD What is The Sinqularity? The acceleration of technological progress has been the central feature of this century. I argue in this paper that we are on the edge of change comparable to the rise of human life on Earth. The precise cause of this change is the imminent creation by technology of entities with greater than human intelligence. There are several means by which science may achieve this breakthrough (and this is another reason for having confidence that the event will occur): o The development of computers that are ""awake"" and superhumanly intelligent. (To date, most controversy in the area of AI relates to whether we can create human equivalence in a machine. But if the answer is ""yes, we can"", then there is little doubt that beings more intelligent can be constructed shortly thereafter. o Large computer networks (and their associated users) may ""wake up"" as a superhumanly intelligent entity. o Computer/human interfaces may become so intimate that users may reasonably be considered superhumanly intelligent. o Biological science may find ways to improve upon the natural human intellect. The first three possibilities depend in large part on improvements in computer hardware. Progress in computer hardware has followed an amazingly steady curve in the last few decades [16]. Based largely on this trend, I believe that the creation of greater than human intelligence will occur during the next thirty years. (Charles Platt [19] has pointed out the AI enthusiasts have been making claims like this for the last thirty years. Just so I\'m not guilty of a relative-time ambiguity, let me more specific: I\'ll be surprised if this event occurs before 2005 or after 2030.) What are the consequences of this event? When greater-than-human intelligence drives progress, that progress will be much more rapid. In fact, there seems no reason why progress itself would not involve the creation of still more intelligent entities -on a still-shorter time scale. The best analogy that I see is with the evolutionary past: Animals can adapt to problems and make inventions, but often no faster than natural selection can do its work -the world acts as its own simulator in the case of natural selection. We humans have the ability to internalize the world and conduct ""what if\'s"" in our heads; we can solve many problems thousands of times faster than natural selection. Now, by creating the means to execute those simulations at much higher speeds, we are entering a regime as radically different from our human past as we humans are from the lower animals. From the human point of view this change will be a throwing away of all the previous rules, perhaps in the blink of an eye, an exponential runaway beyond any hope of control. Developments that before were thought might only happen in ""a million years"" (if ever) will likely happen in the next century. (In [4], Greg Bear paints a picture of the major changes happening in a matter of hours.) I think it\'s fair to call this event a singularity (""the Singularity"" for the purposes of this paper). It is a point where our models must be discarded and a new reality rules. As we move closer and closer to this point, it will loom vaster and vaster over human affairs till the notion becomes a con_monplace.

But slavishly obeying that conventional wisdom can also threaten a company’s ability to compete. The difficulty is that fully understanding customers’ needs is often a costly and inexact process. Even when customers know precisely what they want, they often cannot transfer that information to manufacturers clearly or completely. Today, as the pace of change in many markets accelerates and as some industries move toward serving “markets of one,” the cost of understanding and responding to customers’ needs can easily spiral out of control. In the course of studying product innovation across many industries, we have discovered that a number of companies have adopted an intriguing approach, which at first seems counterintuitive. Essentially, these companies have abandoned their efforts to understand exactly what products their customers want and have instead equipped them with tools to design and develop their own products, ranging from minor modifications to major new innovations. The user-friendly tools, often integrated into a package we call a “tool kit for customer innovation,” deploy new technologies like computer simulation and rapid prototyping to make product development faster and less expensive. A variety of industries use this approach. Bush Boake Allen (BBA), a global supplier of specialty flavors to companies like Nestlé, has built a tool kit that enables its cus“L tomers to develop their own flavors, which BBA then manufactures. In the materials field, GE provides customers with Web-based tools for designing better plastic products. In software, a number of companies let people add custom-designed modules to their standard products and then commercialize the best of those components. Opensource software allows users to design, build, distribute, and support their own programs – no manufacturer required. Indeed, the trend toward customers as innovators has the power to completely transform industries. In the semiconductor business, it has led to a custom-chip market that has grown to more than $15 billion. Tapping into customer innovation can certainly generate tremendous value, but capturing that value is hardly a simple or straightforward process. Not only must companies develop the right tool kit, they must also revamp their business models as well as their management mind-sets. When companies relinquish a fundamental task – such as designing a new product – to customers, the two parties must redefine their relationship, and this change can be risky. With custom computer chips, for instance, companies traditionally captured value by both designing and manufacturing innovative products. Now, with customers taking over more of the design task, companies must focus more intently on providing the best custom manufacturing. In other words, the location where value is both created and captured changes, and companies must reconfigure their business models accordingly. In this article, we offer some basic principles and lessons for industries undergoing such a transformation.

We asked 24 skilled typists (WPM = 70.7 T 16.4) to type 600 words, each of which was followed by a fouralternative explicit report screen. Typists typed 91.8% of the words correctly. Mean interkeystroke intervals, plotted in Fig. 3A, show post-error slowing for incorrect responses (F1,138 = 117.7, p < 0.01) and corrected errors (F1,138 = 120.0, p < 0.01), but not for inserted errors (F < 1.0), indicating that inner-loop detection distinguishes between actual errors and correct responses. Explicit detection probabilities, plotted in Fig. 3B, show good discrimination between correct and error responses. For correct responses, typists said “correct”more than “error” [t(23) = 97.29, p < 0.01]; for error responses, typists said “error” more than “correct” [t(23) = 8.22, p < 0.01]. Typists distinguished actual errors from inserted errors well, avoiding an illusion of authorship. They said “error”more than “inserted” for actual errors [t(23) = 7.06, p < 0.01] and “inserted”more than “error” for inserted errors [t(23) = 14.75, p < 0.01]. However, typists showed a strong illusion of authorship with corrected errors. They were just as likely to call them correct responses as corrected errors [t(23) = 1.38]. The post-error slowing and post-trial report data show a dissociation between innerand outerloop error detection.We assessed the dissociation further by comparing post-error slowing on trials in which typists did and did not experience illusions of authorship (21). The pattern of posterror slowing was the same for both sets of trials (fig. S6), suggesting that the pattern in Fig. 3A is representative of all trials. The three experiments found strong dissociations between explicit error reports and post-error slowing. These dissociations are consistent with the hierarchical error-detectionmechanism that we proposed, with an outer loop that mediates explicit reports and an inner loop that mediates posterror slowing. This nested-loop description of error detection is consistent with hierarchical models of cognitive control in typewriting (9, 10, 15–17) and with models of hierarchical control in other complex tasks (2, 8, 22). Speaking, playingmusic, and navigating through space may all involve inner loops that take care of the details of performance (e.g., uttering phonemes, playing notes, and walking) and outer loops that ensure that intentions are fulfilled (e.g., messages communicated, songs performed, and destinations reached). Hierarchical control may be prevalent in highly skilled performers who have had enough practice to develop an autonomous inner loop. Previous studies of error detection in simple tasks may describe inner-loop processing. The novel contribution of our research is to dissociate the outer loop from the inner loop. The three experiments demonstrate cognitive illusions of authorship in skilled typewriting (11–14). Typists readily take credit for correct output on the screen, interpreting corrected errors as their own correct responses. They take the blame for inserted errors, as in the first and second experiments, but they also blame the computer, as in the third experiment. These illusions are consistent with the hierarchical model of error detection, with the outer loop assigning credit and blame and the inner loop doing the work of typing (10, 17). Thus, illusions of authorship may be a hallmark of hierarchical control systems (2, 11, 22, 23). References and Notes 1. P. M. A. Rabbitt, J. Exp. Psychol. 71, 264 (1966). 2. D. A. Norman, Psychol.

Surowiecki defines various conditions for the successful application of the “Wisdom of Crowds”, such as diversity in opinions, independence, and decentrality of group members or within a group. Thus, best collective decisions are not made by consensus building and compromises, but through a competition of heterogeneous independent opinions, i.e. through the usage of collective intelligence (Surowiecki 2004).

Through a review of the literature, the paper surveys the basic viewpoints of design thinking, paying particular attention to the perspective of design research and design education. Two viewpoints are discussed: the “analysis of design” viewpoint and the “human-centered problem solving” one. The necessity of design thinking to be conceptualized and taught in an effective and practical way has been pointed out. Furthermore, the teaching of design thinking should be comprehensive and attempt to develop design-thinking skills to the fullest. Finally, education in design thinking can be seen as an indispensable research “ground” for understanding and enhancing human creativity and innovation in a wide range of fields.')","('authors', [])","('filename', '-DesignThinkingAnOverview.pdf')","('title', '')"

This introduction was composed, after all, at a café, on a computer that fits in an overcoat pocket. Before Kay and Goldberg began to outline the visions in this paper, such a possibility was seldom imagined, even in vague terms, by computing researchers. The prescience of Kay and Goldberg’s vision was such that almost all the specific ideas for the uses of notebook computing developed in the group that Kay directed at Xerox Palo Alto Research Center (PARC) proved to be worthwhile. The broader idea—that the notebook computer would be a general-purpose device, with educators and businesspeople and poets all using the same type of Dynabook—has also held true. The Dynabook vision came about because Kay, Goldberg, and others in their Learning Research Group at Xerox PARC considered the computer from a radically different perspective. (This approach may be the central maneuver in new media’s otherwise varied methodology.) While most saw the computer as a tool for engineers or, at most, businesspeople, Kay thought computers could be used even by children, and could be used creatively. Kay and Goldberg also upset the idea that time-sharing computing is liberating for users, as J. C. R. Licklider (◊05) had more appropriately thought during the batch computing era. Instead, they believed that in the mid-1970s providing powerful, dedicated computers to individuals was a superior approach. Their group at Xerox PARC developed not only the notebook computer, but the essence of the personal desktop computer as well, which came to be embodied in Xerox’s Alto. The desktop computer revolution would take hold before notebooks became widespread, of course. It was in the 1980s that home computers brought a new context to computing and revealed a host of new possible digital activities. The development of the Dynabook vision and the powerful Alto personal computer created the elements that were used to produce the Star computer by the Xerox Systems Development Division, headed by David Liddle (formerly of PARC). The Star system sported a graphical user interface, which became part of popular personal computing via Apple’s Macintosh. (Kay’s fame is partially based on his invention of overlapping windows.) The Star system also helped to make Ethernet, the mouse, the laser printer, and WYIWYG printing a part of today’s everyday computer environment. As with the movement of elements such as the mouse from Engelbart’s ARC (◊16) to Kay’s group at PARC, significant changes in focus took place in the move from the Alto to the Star. The “virtual paper” and desktop metaphors became further entrenched, while flexible knowledge spaces and usercreated tools received less emphasis. Apple made changes of its own. One was in the meaning of Star’s icons, which were originally only to represent documents, never applications. Apple’s model was later adopted nearly wholesale by Microsoft (the exceptions were certain touches from systems such as Motif and NeXT, or from within Microsoft) and made into the dominant computing platform in the world. With today’s rise in handheld computing the desktop and virtual paper metaphors are meeting a significant challenge, and may themselves fade. Still, the important original idea of opening tool creation to every user—even children—has not returned to prominence. Kay, however, continues to pursue this vision through his Squeak project. Certain aspects of notebook computing weren’t foretold in the essay that follows—even though the Dynabook idea is among the most influential and prescient of the past thirty years. While Kay and Goldberg predicted that businesspeople could carry along “the last several weeks of correspondence in a structured cross-indexed form” and wireless communications capability was an essential part of the Dynabook concept, they didn’t emphasize how notebook computers (and other personal computers) would find so much use as networked communication devices.

However, during the past few decades, considerable changes in body weight and body composition were observed, as a result of which, new in vivo technologies of body composition analysis are now available. Thus, the Reference Man might be outdated as adequate standard to assess medication and radiation doses. The objective of this study was to compare body composition of an adult population with 1975 Reference Man data, thereby questioning its value as a suitable reference. Methods: Body composition was assessed in 208 healthy, Caucasian subjects (105 males, 103 females) aged 18–78 years with a body mass index range of 16.8–35.0 kg/m. Fat mass (FM) and muscle mass (MM) were assessed by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, organ masses (OMs) were measured by magnetic resonance imaging. Results: There was a considerable variance in body weight and body composition. When compared with Reference Man, great differences in body composition were found. Men and women of the study population were heavier, taller and had more FM, MM and higher masses of brain, heart and spleen. These differences did not depend on age. Relationships between body weight and body composition were investigated by general linear regression models, whereby deviations in FM, MM and heart mass disappeared, whereas differences in brain and spleen mass persisted. Conclusions: Our data indicate the need of a modern Reference Man and thus a recalculation of medical radiation doses and medication.

These narratives are widely accepted as common sense; however, recent research suggests that they are, in fact, misleading. Not only were clocks widely employed before the industrial revolution, but people’s use of this technology is also more complex and should not be reduced to efficiency and discipline. Laborers in the Middle Ages negotiated work conditions based on time spent on the job, and task-based time still persists nowadays, even in contexts regarded as dominated by the clock. Though there are many examples of actions that are organized and coordinated through a globalized network of time, there is still a range of local, idiosyncratic, and context-dependent time awareness that continues to play important roles in our lives. Different cultures, groups, and individuals create their own temporal infrastructures to anticipate, delay, and negotiate time through everyday interactions; and our bodily and social rhythms are still strongly influenced by daily and seasonal cycles. In other words, time is more nuanced than we often assume. Disregarding this pluralism feeds into the exclusion of certain practices, individuals, and natures, and supports the dominance of others, creating problematic experiences of time. The dominance A number of publications have been concerned with the ways in which digital networks and systems may affect perceptions of time and everyday rhythms. Concerns are often directed to how new technologies may contribute to an overall speeding up of everyday life, and the negative consequences of this influence. In this forum I would like to turn the discussion around and challenge designers and HCI researchers to question the very idea of a dominant condition of acceleration. I suggest the focus on acceleration has restricted our imaginative and explorative possibilities, and propose that instead of focusing on frameworks that assume a single time, we adopt a more pluralistic approach to temporality, investigating the multiple ways in which time is expressed in the world. Our approach to temporality often simply reinforces the very idea of acceleration. On the one hand, we assume that only those who are able to keep up with a fast pace are likely to succeed. Therefore, we take on the role of developing artifacts and systems that would help people to catch up with such fast rhythms. On the other hand, we perceive this acceleration as problematic and consider how technology could promote a slowing down, or how it could help individuals to cope with this acceleration. In both cases, however, we assume acceleration as universal, which does not necessarily correspond to how time is expressed in the world. PARADIGMS OF A SINGLE TIME Over the past half century, much research on temporality has nurtured the idea of time as a single, allencompassing expression, which has been accelerated by new technological developments. Several publications portray time prior to the industrial revolution as being task-focused and, as such, flexibly managed by workers who were able to respond to the unevenness of natural and social rhythms. However, with the shift to hourly labor, the separation of work and leisure into specific periods of the day, and the drive to maximize profits through increased productivity, the industrial revolution is said to have inaugurated, through the deployment of clocks and calendars, a new temporal discipline that would divorce Westerners from an intuitive and embodied relationship to time.

A growing body of evidence suggests that this is not the case. Experimental findings from several disciplines indicate considerable variation among human populations in diverse domains, such as visual perception, analytic reasoning, fairness, cooperation, memory and the heritability of IQ. This is in line with what anthropologists have long suggested: that people from Western, educated, industrialized, rich and democratic (WEIRD) societies — and particularly American undergraduates — are some of the most psychologically unusual people on Earth. So the fact that the vast majority of studies use WEIRD participants presents a challenge to the understanding of human psychology and behaviour. A 2008 survey of the top psychology journals found that 96% of subjects were from Western industrialized countries — which house just 12% of the world’s population. Strange, then, that research articles routinely assume that their results are broadly representative, rarely adding even a cautionary footnote on how far their findings can be generalized. The evidence that basic cognitive and motivational processes vary across populations has become increasingly difficult to ignore. For example, many studies have shown that Americans, Canadians and western Europeans rely on analytical reasoning strategies — which separate objects from their contexts and rely on rules to explain and predict behaviour — substantially more than non-Westerners. Research also indicates that Americans use analytical thinking more than, say, Europeans. By contrast, Asians tend to reason holistically, for example by considering people’s behaviour in terms of their situation. Yet many long-standing theories of how humans perceive, categorize and remember emphasize the centrality of analytical thought. It is a similar story with social behaviour related to fairness and equality. Here, researchers often use one-shot economic experiments such as the ultimatum game, in which a player decides how much of a fixed amount to offer a second player, who can then accept or reject this proposal. If the second player rejects it, neither player gets anything. Participants from industrialized societies tend to divide the money equally, and reject low offers. People from non-industrialized societies behave differently, especially in the smallest-scale nonmarket societies such as foragers in Africa and horticulturalists in South America, where people are neither inclined to make equal offers nor to punish those who make low offers.')","('authors', [])","('filename', '!henrich2010.pdf')","('title', '')"

While I am gratified that others have found the event of its publication notable (and I make no judgment or claims for anything beyond the event itself), producing a commentary feels self-congratulating to a degree that I find uncomfortable. Nonetheless, in a field that prizes novelty and innovation so dearly, it makes a pleasant change to be asked to spend a moment looking backwards, and an assessment of how both the research and the technology landscape have developed over the last ten years may be instructive in figuring out where to go next. It is hardly necessary at this point to comment on the technological and interactional trends since Where the Action Is was published in 2001 that have helped to fuel an interest in the topics of embodied interaction. Further, the articles collected in this issue are testament to the variety of theoretical and analytic perspectives that have been brought to bear by a wide range of researchers. The articles here do important work in situating HCI’s interest in embodied interaction within a broader and varied intellectual history. Indeed, many of the researchers represented are people whose own work directly inspired the writing of that text, and with whom my own work has been in dialogue over many years. Indeed, if the book has achieved anything, I would say that it is not that it broke any new ground in understanding the nature of embodiment as a phenomenon in HCI, but rather perhaps that it invited new people to participate in a conversation that was already going on. With the benefit of hindsight, and in light of the kinds of explorations explored in the articles collected in this issue, there are a number of observations that we might make about the broad trajectory of research on embodied interaction and the position of that specific volume within it. The first, as has been noted by several people, is that the body has remarkably little presence in a book that is ostensibly about embodied interaction. This is certainly true, and is valid as critique, although, of course, the book has a slightly different focus. Ironically, in fact, although it sets out to explore “embodied interaction,” Where the Action Is represents, in some sense, an attempt to argue that then-emerging trends in physically embodied interactive computing could be understood best in terms of existing analytic frameworks such as those of ethnomethodology, that is, it was to some extent an attempt to lead away from the “novelty” of those techniques and back to the kinds of concerns that had already been occupying many researchers in CSCW and related areas. From this perspective, then, the absence of the body as a central consideration was somewhat strategic, if problematic. Indeed, in light of subsequent events, I wonder if having focused more on bodies in interaction might have turned out to be a problem (see below). Certainly, it meant that there were many important issues to which the text was largely blind (despite Toni Robertson’s best efforts, over dinner in San Francisco one evening while the book was still in development, to get me to see them). Certainly, I am happy to see a whole range of more thoughtful perspectives on the body in interaction—from feminist technoscience (e.g., Satchell [2006], Borning')","('authors', [{'name': 'PAUL DOURISH', 'affiliations': []}])","('filename', '-a2-dourish.pdf')","('title', '')"

Even though artificial neural networks that apply deep learning have made much headway over the last few years, some computer scientists think they can do better with systems that even more closely resemble a living brain. Such neuromorphic computing, as this brain emulation is known, might not only accomplish tasks that current computers cannot, it could also lead to a clearer understanding of how human memory and cognition work. Also, if researchers can figure out how to build the machines out of analog circuits, they could run them with a fraction of the energy needed by modern computers. “The real driver for neuromorphic computing is energy efficiency, and the current design space on CMOS isn’t particularly energy efficient,” says Mark Stiles, a physicist who is a project leader in the Center for Nanoscale Science and Technology at the U.S. National Institutes for Standards and Technology (NIST) in Gaithersburg, MD.

Artificial neural networks, which are patterned after the arrangement of neurons in the brain and the connections between them, are at the heart of much of modern AI, and to do a good job on hard problems they require teraflops of processing power and terabytes of training data. Michael Witbrock, a manager of Cognitive Systems at IBM Research, says about two-thirds of the advances in AI over the past 10 years have come from increases in computer processing power, much of that from the use of graphics processing units (GPUs). About 20% of the gain came from bigger datasets, and 10% from better algorithms, he estimates. That’s changing, he says; “Advances in the fundamental algorithms for learning are now the main driver of progress.” Witbrock points, for example, to a technique called reinforcement learning, “systems which can build models that hypothesize about what the world might look like.” In reA R T I F I C I A L I N T E L L I G E N C E ( A I ) , once described as a technology with permanent potential, has come of age in the past decade. Propelled by massively parallel computer systems, huge datasets, and better algorithms, AI has brought a number of important applications, such as imageand speech-recognition and autonomous vehicle navigation, to near-human levels of performance. Now, AI experts say, a wave of even newer technology may enable systems to understand and react to the world in ways that traditionally have been seen as the sole province of human beings. These technologies include algorithms that model human intuition and make predictions in the face of incomplete knowledge, systems that learn without being pre-trained with labeled data, systems that transfer knowledge gained in one domain to another, hybrid systems that combine two or more approaches, and more powerful and energy-efficient hardware specialized for AI. The term “artificial intelligence” was coined by John McCarthy, a math professor at Dartmouth, in 1955 when he—along with Marvin Minsky of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), Claude Shannon of Bell Laboratories, and Nathaniel Rochester of IBM—said they would study “the conjecture that every aspect of learning or any other feature of intelligence can in principle be so precisely described that a machine can be made to simulate it.” McCarthy wanted to “find out how to make machines use language, form abstractions and concepts, solve kinds of problems now reserved for humans, and improve themselves.” That is not a bad description of the goals of AI today. The path of AI over the ensuing 62 years has been anything but smooth. There were early successes in areas such as mathematical problem solving, natural language, and robotics. Some of the ideas that are central to modern AI, such as those behind neural networks, made conceptual advances early on. Yet funding for AI research, mostly from the U.S. government, ebbed and flowed, and when it ebbed the private sector did not take up the slack.

In the field of software engineering, the term “evolution” has been used for gradual change of single, typically large, programs (see for example Lehman). In this Viewpoint, I use “evolution” in a true Darwinian sense, where it refers to populations, not individuals, and it is driven by procreation, mutation, and survival. My claim is more radical than that individual programs change gradually. It is that populations of programs evolve along with the human cultures that use and develop them. To understand my interpretation requires looking beyond the software engineering literature. The philosopher Daniel Dennett makes the case that the human mind, consciousness, language, and culture, are the result of a Darwinian evolution. He points to digital technology and software as a canonical example of an opposite kind of design, what he calls “top-down intelligent design” Viewpoint Is Software the Result of Top-Down Intelligent Design or Evolution?')","('authors', [{'name': 'Edward A.

To accomplish this, the system integrates a range of AI technologies: deep natural language understanding, knowledge representation and reasoning, dialogue systems, planning/agent-based systems and machine learning. A formal evaluation shows the approach has great promise. Introduction To further human-machine interaction, there is a great need to develop collaborative agents that can act autonomously yet still collaborate with their human teammates. In this paper we present PLOW, an intelligent automated software assistant that helps people manage their everyday tasks; our focus will be on how such agents can acquire the task models they need from intuitive language-rich demonstrations by humans. PLOW uses the same collaborative architecture to learn tasks as it does to perform tasks. The system displays an integrated intelligence that results from sophisticated natural language understanding, reasoning, leaming, and acting capabilities unified within a collaborative agent architecture. In this paper, we report on recent work on how this agent combines its capabilities to learn new tasks. A recent evaluation shows great promise: our system can quickly learn new tasks from human subjects using modest amounts of interaction. Background In previous work, researchers have attempted to learn new tasks by observation, creating agents that learn through observing an expert's demonstration (Angros et al. 2002, Lau & Weld 1999; Lent & Laird 2001). These techniques require observing multiple examples of the same task, and the number of training examples required increases dramatically with the complexity of the task. To be effective, however, collaborative assistants need to be able to acquire Copyright © 2007, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (www.aaai.org). All rights reserved. tasks much more quickly — typically from a single example, possibly with some clarification dialogue. To enable this, ir1 our system the teacher not only demonstrates the task, but also gives a “play-by-play” description of what they are doing. This is a natural method that people already use when teaching other people, and our system exploits this natural capability. By combining the information from understanding with prior knowledge and a concrete example demonstrated by the user, our system can learn complex tasks involving iterative loops in a single short training session. Task Learning Challenges As in all learning, a core challenge in task learning is identifying the appropriate generalizations, which are key to allow the learned task model to be successfully applied to new arguments in new contexts. When viewing this as a traditional learning-by-observation problem using traces of executions, an additional challenge involves identifying parts of the task models that are not explicit in the observed actions. For instance, if a user executes a conditional step equivalent to the form, “if A then B else C”, then the trace will only contain one action, B or C, depending on whether the “hidden” condition A is true. Even if we have multiple training examples we still only observe that either B or C is performed. Identifying that A is the relevant condition from the context is an exceptionally hard problem that requires considering the entire context of the demonstration as training data. In our approach, we identify the condition A from one example because the demonstrator often mentions the condition in the play-by-play commentary. When viewed from the perspective of human learning andfor integrated agents, this is a completely natural and ordinary example. Our agent fuses the information from the language understanding with the observed demonstration to construct these complex task models. There are many other aspects of tasks that are difficult to learn but become much easier with a play-by-play. Some of the key ones include: ° Identifying the correct parameterization: is a value in the training an example of a parameter value or a constant?

For comparison, China’s Tianhe-2, the world’s most powerful supercomputer as of September 2013, provides only 3.39×1016 FLOPS. In recent decades, it has taken approximately 6.7 years for commodity computers to increase in power by one order of magnitude. Even a century of continued Moore’s law would not be enough to close this gap. Running more specialized hardware, or allowing longer run-times, could contribute only a few more orders of magnitude. This figure is conservative in another respect. Evolution achieved human intelligence without aiming at this outcome. In other words, the fitness functions for natural organisms do not select only for intelligence and its precursors.13 Even environments in which organisms with superior information processing skills reap various rewards may not select for intelligence, because improvements to intelligence can (and often do) impose significant costs, such as higher energy consumption or slower maturation times, and those costs may outweigh whatever benefits are gained from smarter behavior. Excessively deadly environments also reduce the value of intelligence: the shorter one’s expected lifespan, the less time there will be for increased learning ability to pay off. Reduced selective pressure for intelligence slows the spread of intelligence-enhancing innovations, and thus the opportunity for selection to favor subsequent innovations that depend on them. Furthermore, evolution may wind up stuck in local optima that humans would notice and bypass by altering tradeoffs between exploitation and exploration or by providing a smooth progression of increasingly difficult intelligence tests.14 And as mentioned earlier, evolution scatters much of its selection power on traits that are unrelated to intelligence (such as Red Queen’s races of competitive co-evolution between immune systems and parasites). Evolution continues to waste resources producing mutations that have proved consistently lethal, and it fails to take advantage of statistical similarities in the effects of different mutations. These are all inefficiencies in natural selection (when viewed as a means of evolving intelligence) that it would be relatively easy for a human engineer to avoid while using evolutionary algorithms to develop intelligent software. It is plausible that eliminating inefficiencies like those just described would trim many orders of magnitude off the 1031–1044 FLOPS range calculated earlier. Unfortunately, it is difficult to know how many orders of magnitude.

In the movie, Terminator 2, SkyNet is an AI that runs the nuclear arsenal “with a perfect operational record,” but when its emerging self-awareness scares its human operators into trying to pull the plug, it defends itself by triggering a nuclear war to eliminate its enemies (along with billions of other humans). In the movie, Robot & Frank, in order to promote Frank’s activity and health, an eldercare robot helps Frank resume his career as a jewel thief. In both of these cases, the robot or AI is doing exactly what it has been instructed to do, but in unexpected ways, and without the moral, ethical, or commonsense constraints to avoid catastrophic consequences. An intelligent robot perceives the world through its senses, and builds its own model of the world. Humans provide its goals and its planning algorithms, but those algorithms generate their own subgoals as needed in the situation. In this sense, it makes its own decisions, creating and carrying out plans to achieve its goals in the context of the world, as it understands it to be. A robot has a well-defined body that senses and acts in the world but, like a self-driving car, its body need not be anthropomorphic. AIs without welldefined bodies may also perceive and act in the world, such as realworld, high-speed trading systems or the fictional SkyNet. This article describes the key role of trust in human society, the value of morality and ethics to encourage trust, and the performance requirements for moral and ethical decisions.

How should we make this tradeoff between mobility and safety? What is the right balance? These are hard questions about the values that we build into self-driving cars. The ongoing debate on the ethics of selfdriving cars typically focuses on two approaches to answering such questions: moral philosophy and social science. Although each has its place, both approaches fall short. The first approach turns to moral theories. For example, a utilitarian theory that seeks to maximize overall A S A D RIVER, have you ever asked yourself whether to make left turns? Unprotected left turns, that is, left turns with oncoming traffic, are among the most difficult and dangerous driving maneuvers. Although the risk of each individual left turn is negligible, if you are designing the behavior of a large fleet of self-driving cars, small individual risks add up to a significant number of expected injuries in the aggregate. Whether a fleet of cars should make left turns is a question that any developer of self-driving cars and any designer of mapping and routing applications faces today. A more general issue is at stake here: the decision of whether to make left turns involves a trade-off between safety and mobility (the time it takes to get to a destination). You gain safety at the expense of mobility by driving around the block and thereby avoiding left turns. But you gain mobility at the expense of safety by designing self-driving cars to zip through small gaps in oncoming traffic. Other situations that exemplify this mobility—safety trade-offs include merging onto highway lanes, driving through crosswalks with limited visibility, or avoiding detours by routing through school zones.

It considers the science, engineering, and deployment of AI-enabled computing systems. As its core activity, the Standing Committee that oversees the One Hundred Year Study forms a Study Panel every five years to assess the current state of AI. The Study Panel reviews AI’s progress in the years following the immediately prior report, envisions the potential advances that lie ahead, and describes the technical and societal challenges and opportunities these advances raise, including in such arenas as ethics, economics, and the design of systems compatible with human cognition. The overarching purpose of the One Hundred Year Study’s periodic expert review is to provide a collected and connected set of reflections about AI and its influences as the field advances. The studies are expected to develop syntheses and assessments that provide expert-informed guidance for directions in AI research, development, and systems design, as well as programs and policies to help ensure that these systems broadly benefit individuals and society.1 The One Hundred Year Study is modeled on an earlier effort informally known as the “AAAI Asilomar Study.” During 2008-2009, the then president of the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AAAI), Eric Horvitz, assembled a group of AI experts from multiple institutions and areas of the field, along with scholars of cognitive science, philosophy, and law. Working in distributed subgroups, the participants addressed near-term AI developments, long-term possibilities, and legal and ethical concerns, and then came together in a three-day meeting at Asilomar to share and discuss their findings. A short written report on the intensive meeting discussions, amplified by the participants’ subsequent discussions with other colleagues, generated widespread interest and debate in the field and beyond. The impact of the Asilomar meeting, and important advances in AI that included AI algorithms and technologies starting to enter daily life around the globe, spurred the idea of a long-term recurring study of AI and its influence on people and society.

Colloquially referred to as “AI100,” the project issued its first report in September 2016. A standing committee of AI scientists and scholars in the humanities and social sciences working with the Stanford faculty director of AI100 oversees the project and the design of its activities. A little more than two years after the first report appeared, we reflect on the decisions made in shaping it, the process that produced it, its major conclusions, and reactions subsequent to its release. The inaugural AI100 report, called Artificial Intelligence and Life in 2030, examined eight domains of human activity in which AI technologies are already beginning to affect urban life. In scope, it encompasses domains with emerging products enabled by AI methods and domains, raising concerns about technological impact generated by potential AI-enabled systems. The study panel members who wrote the report and the AI100 standing committee, the body that directs the AI100 project, intend for it to be a catalyst, spurring conversations on how we as a society might shape and share the potentially powerful technologies AI could deliver. In addition to influencing researchers and guiding decisions in industry and governments, the report aims to provide the general public with a scientifically and technologically accurate portrayal of the current state of AI, along with that potential. It aspires to replace conceptions rooted in science fiction novels and movies with a realistic foundation for these deliberations.

Even Airbnb may not be totally new economic activity, as it substitutes for traditional bed-and-breakfast revenue or hotel and vacation home rentals. Nonetheless, the confluence of information technology, entrepreneurship, and venture capital has led to the creation of many new ventures, and that is generally good for any economy. Smartphone apps, cloud-based servers, and GPS technology have made various sharing services easy to launch and use.

Tech is often called “Big Tech” these days. Furthermore, a small number of corporations have come to dominate the IT industry, as within each industry segment one corporation often dominates. The phenomenon whereby corporate dominance seems to be entrenched is often referred to as “winner takes all.” In the context of tech, such a phenomenon can be partly explained by two “laws:” Metcalfe’s Law asserts that the effect of a communications network is proportional to the square of the number of connected users. This makes Facebook, with over 1.5B daily users, dominant as a social network. Kai-Fu Lee’s Virtuous Cycle asserts “More data begets more users and profit, which begets more usage and data.” This explains, for example, the dominance of the Google search engine. Metcalfe’s Law and the Virtuous Cycle make tech companies into natural monopolies, some claim. As I argued earlier this year, we need laws and regulations, instead of an ethics outrage, to deal with undesired business models and conduct of tech corporations. What may have been a radical position less than a year ago has become a conventional wisdom now. There are several initiatives to regulate tech; the question now is how rather than if. The biggest regulatory issue on the table is how to deal with overly dominant corporations. In a 2018 book, The Curse of Bigness: Antitrust in the New Gilded Age, legal scholar Tim Wu argues the U.S. must enforce anti-trust laws against such corporations. Public concerns about overly dominant corporations have been aggravated by what has become a dogma in the U.S. business community over the past generation, which is the Shareholder-Primacy Principle, asserting that shareholders should be assigned a priority relative to all other corporate stakeholders, such as employees, customers, and the like. According to this view, the goal of a corporation is just to generate profits, period! This approach, which has emerged in the 1970s and became dogmatic in the 1980s, has replaced the earlier approach of “corporate responsibility,” which made corporations accountable to multiple stakeholders. Sensing public frustration with the narrow profit motive of U.S. corporations, the Business Roundtable, an association of close to 200 influential U.S. CEOs, recently abandoned its 1997 shareholder-primacy position and declared that “the paramount duty of management and boards of directors is to the corporation’s stakeholders.” “Society gives each of us a license to operate,” declared Ginni Rometty, IBM’s CEO. “It’s a question of whether society trusts you or not.” But doubts have been expressed about whether corporations can be trusted to regulate themselves, even after their stakeholder-primacy declaration. In a recent book, The Anarchy, historian William Darlymple describes the history of the East India Company, the most successful and most ruthless start-up in history. “Yet if history shows anything,” write Darlymple, “it is that in the intricate dance between the power of the state and that of the corporation, while the latter can be regulated, the corporation will use all the resources in its power to resists.” One of the formidable resources that corporations can marshal is that of corporate personhood, which gives corporations the same legal rights enjoyed by natural persons. In fact, under U.S. law, some essential rights of the 14 Amendment, which addresses equal protection of the laws, belong not only to U.S. citizens but also to corporations. This has farreaching implications. For example, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 2010 that corporate funding of independent political broadcasts in candidate elections cannot be limited under the First Amendment because of corporate personhood. This had led to a significant flow of corporate funds into U.S. political campaigns—and money buys influence in politics. But the 14 Amendment was passed in response to issues related to former slaves following the American Civil War. How it came to be interpreted to grant personhood to corporations is a long and convoluted tale. Many argue that corporations should not have the same rights as natural persons. As IBM CEO Rometty said, society offers corporations a license to operate, so it makes sense for society to define the terms of that license, including rights and responsibilities, the issue of corporate personhood, and the relationship between shareholders and other stakeholders. Perhaps the time has come to formally define the terms of the relationship between society and corporations via a constitutional amendment that explicitly addresses the rights and responsibilities of corporations.

A classic example is the Industrial Revolution, the massively disruptive transformation of the economy beginning in the 18 century. Industrialization created decades of problems, from changes in job structure and skills demanded to horrendous working conditions for those who did get the new factory jobs; eventually, though, industrialized economies adjusted, with enormous increases in prosperity. A major expansion of education and the rise of labor unions made sure that workers shared in these gains. Similarly, in the first part of the 20 century, in what’s been called the R ARELY DOES A day go by without more news predicting the end of work. After all, autonomous vehicles are all but certain to replace truckers and taxi drivers in the coming decades, and robots have already taken over many jobs in factories and warehouses, and will continue to expand their reach beyond heavy industry as they become smarter and ever more affordable. Perhaps most frighteningly, even professional services no longer seem safe from the encroachment of increasingly sophisticated artificial intelligence (AI). Law firms, for example, employ electronic-discovery software, which uses natural language processing to sift through reams of documents faster and more cheaply than the entry-level lawyers who used to do this tedious work. Deep-learning image recognition tools can flag and classify worrisome tumors in digital scans as well as, or better than, experienced radiologists. Websites like Wealthfront and Betterment, which algorithmically optimize investment portfolios, are giving financial advisors a run for their money. No one doubts that automation is replacing many jobs, but will advances in technology also create plenty of new jobs? If so, what kind(s)? These questions have taken on new urgency in the past year, as the startling rise of populism and the election of U.S. President Donald J. Trump have awakened previously complacent white-collar workers to the plight of the large numbers of Americans left behind by automation and other changes in the U.S. economy over the past several decades. For example, according to a widely reported recent study by economists Daron Acemoglu and Pascual Restrepo, industrial robots alone have eliminated as many as 670,000 U.S. jobs between 1990 and 2007. As some displaced workers stay unemployed, while others must settle for significantly lower-paying work in the retail and service sectors, society pays the price in the form of lower consumer spending, higher crime rates, and a lower tax base. “Two-thirds of people in this country don’t have a four-year degree,” points out Moshe Vardi, senior editor of Communications and a professor of computational engineering at Rice University who writes and lectures on the impact of automation on work. “We have to make sure we have an economy that creates jobs for them—and not only jobs for the people who have a Ph.D. in computer science.” What kinds of jobs will the techdriven economy create?

Think of policing and you are likely to imagine a uniformed patrol officer scanning the environment for suspicious activity. The most powerful tools an officer once possessed were a gun, experience, and training. But new technologies are changing the way the police approach the streets. Automated license plate readers that identify hundreds of plates a minute are commonplace. The Chicago Police Department uses an algorithm that identifies which city residents may be at especially high risk as perpetrators or victims of gun violence.

In a highly popular 1995 Harvard Business Review article, “Disruptive Technologies: Catching the Wave,” coauthored with J.L. Bower, the authors described how leading companies fail to stay at the top of their industries when technologies or markets change. The running example used in the article is the evolution of the hard-disk-drive industry from 1976 to 1992. During this period, disk-drive performance improved at a stunning rate, yet no independent disk-drive company that existed in 1976 survived by 1995. Christensen expounded on the disruptive-innovation concept in a best-selling 1997 book The Innovator’s Dilemma: When New Technologies Cause Great Firms to Fail. Top tech executives such as Amazon’s Jeff Bezos and Apple’s late co-founder Steve Jobs described the book as required reading for tech executives. Christensen came under withering critique in 2014 from Jill Lepore, a Harvard history professor, in a New Yorker article, “The Disruption Machine: What the gospel of innovation gets wrong.” Lepore called Christensen’s sources “dubious” and his logic “questionable,” and described disruptive innovation as “competitive strategy for an age seized by terror.” A year later, Andrew A. King and Baljir Baatartogtokh argued, in an MIT Sloan Management Review article “How Useful Is the Theory of Disruptive Innovation?,” that the idea had little predictive power. Other scholars have come to Christensen’s defense. But the disruptive innovation genie is out of the bottle and no scholarly debate will put it back there. Whether or not it has predictive power, it is a powerful story that explains the rise and fall of tech empires. By now it is deeply embedded in the psyche of Silicon Valley, and the phrase “to disrupt” has become a mantra of Silicon Valley business plans. Because people believe the disruptive innovation story, it shapes their behavior. The disruption ideology has further mutated into what used to be, until 2014, Facebook’s motto, “Move fast and break things. Unless you are breaking stuff, you are not moving fast enough.” A company that epitomizes this approach is Uber. Its business model—of creating a platform to connect drivers and passengers—was absolutely brilliant. The transportation service Uber provided was vastly superior to that offered by taxi cabs, which led to its immense popularity and meteoric growth. The fact that this mode of transportation service violated traffic laws in many localities was ignored as a mere technicality. It is no wonder Uber was described by some as “a borderline criminal enterprise.” The break-things ideology was addressed in a 2017 book by Jonathan Taplin Move Fast and Break Things: How Facebook, Google, and Amazon Cornered Culture and Undermined Democracy. Taplin’s basic thesis is that Silicon Valley does increasingly resemble “some kind of nightmarish children’s playground, populated by overgrown babies with no idea of the consequences of their actions.” While the book is thinly argued, the clamor against Silicon Valley is getting louder by the day.

ICT use starts with the inclusion of people in the digital society and progresses toward the equalization of their capabilities and opportunities in technology-mediated information and communication processes. Approaches to inclusion and equality have become increasingly sophisticated through developments in humancentered computing and human-computer interaction that replace the old focus on people’s mere access to the ICTs. At the same time, a third, more empowering moment of ICT use is attracting scholars, professionals and, hopefully, public agents—the effectiveness with which people use the technology. In this article, I discuss inclusion, equality and effectiveness under the concept of one’s digital effectiveness. Digital effectiveness manifests in three dimensions—access, cognition, and behavior. It refers to one’s use of ICTs for private or professional purposes according to an arbitrarily defined effectiveness criterion. The focal point of digital effectiveness is the individual ICT user and the levels of purposeful ICT use he or she achieves. That is, the focus is on the basic building block of the digital society—the embryo of a society’s digital culture and digital health. Digital effectiveness describes an individual’s use of ICTs in desirable ways, regardless of whether the individual masters the ICTs or not. This approach is an extension of the two-order digital divide perspective coupled with developments in use effectiveness.3,7,8 The rationale is as follows: (1) an individual should have proper access to the ICTs, (2) possess the cognitive potential to use them, and (3) activate the needed behaviors to operate the ICTs in practice (4) for a specific purpose (5) in reference to an effectiveness criterion (6) arbitrarily defined and measured against a stakeholder’s utility function (7) that takes as input the individual’s digital capabilities and limitations.

What most of these ventures have in common is they function as transaction platforms. That is, they bring together two or more market sides to exchange information, goods, or services, including advertisements. The businesses can grow rapidly through the power of network effects whereby one market actor (for example, sellers) attracts another side (for example, buyers) in a self-reinforcing positive feedback loop. The more populated one side becomes, the more value and participation we see on the other side. Transaction platforms contrast with innovation platforms, such as Microsoft Windows, Apple iOS, Google Android, or the Facebook and WeChat APIs. These foundational products or technologies generate network effects by linking users with third-party providers of applications and services. All platforms connect multiple market participants and can get big fast if they generate strong network effects and do not have a lot of digital or conventional competition. But there are significant differences in business models. Microsoft and Apple mostly sell products. Google gives away software and digital services but then sells advertisements. Airbnb matches people with rooms for rent to possible renters and charges a fee when a match occurs.

The present investigation was an attempt to study the peer-review process directly, in the natural setting of actual journal referee evaluations of submitted manuscripts. As test materials we selected 12 already published research articles by investigators from prestigious and highly productive American psychology departments, one article from each of 12 highly regarded and widely read American psychology journals with high rejection rates (80%) and nonblind refereeing practices. With fictitious names and institutions substituted for the original ones (e.g., Tri-Valley Center for Human Potential), the altered manuscripts were formally resubmitted to the journals that had originally refereed and published them 18 to 32 months earlier. Of the sample of 38 editors and reviewers, only three (8%) detected the resubmissions. This result allowed nine of the 12 articl-es to continue through the review process to receive an actual evaluation: eight of the nine were rejected.

Two ways to respond to that in the short term are to “start trying to hire like crazy,” Fussell says, and compromise your quality standards, or leave enrollments open and have very large programs, which translates into increased competition for courses. At UT Austin, the solution has been to put a cap on the number of computer science majors, Fussell says. “It’s not so much a shortage (of faculty), it’s just when you grow that quickly, there’s no quick way” to find enough qualified teachers to meet the demand for courses, he says. Fussell says his department is hiring new faculty members on a nontenured track “much more aggressively,” which works out well, “because these folks are really good teachers. But the pay scales are such that it’s hard to offer compelling salaries” at a state-run university. A typical non-tenured position at UT Austin commands under $100,000 for a six-course, nine-month teaching load, he says. “Anyone with reasonable experience in the [computer science] industry is going to be looking at something twice that much. So that’s the problem.” The problem also exists at private institutions, not only because industry pays so much better, but also because there is a shortage of CS Ph.D. candidates, and a doctorate is a requirement for tenure-track positions. RIT, which has over 4,200 students enrolled in gradT HE ONLY EXPOSURE Yancarlos Diaz had to computer science during his high school years in New York City was when he used a computer to write essays. When it came time to apply to college, Diaz, who says he was good in math, “blindly signed up” for the computer science program at the Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT), figuring it was a major that would help him easily find a job when he graduated. That decision already is paying off. Now a fourth-year student at RIT, Diaz expects to graduate in 2021 with dual bachelor and master of science degrees in computer science (CS). He then plans to work in the private sector as a software engineer “mainly to pay the loans,’’ he says. Diaz is not alone. Colleges are not producing large numbers of CS majors, and many of those who graduate with a CS degree are opting to go into industry rather than academia, which can pay twice as much as what professors earn. This is causing a perfect storm: a shortage of computer science teachers is making it harder for many students majoring in the discipline to get into the classes they need to graduate. Finding enough qualified computer science teachers is also an issue in secondary education. Only 36 teachers graduated from universities with computer science degrees in 2017, compared with 11,157 math teachers and 11,905 science teachers, according to the nonprofit Code.org. In 2016, 75 teachers graduated from universities equipped to teach the subject, the organization reports. “I can say at the K–12 level there’s a dramatic shortage’’ of computer science teachers, says Jake Baskin, executive director of the Computer Science Teachers Association (CSTA), which worked with Code.org to produce a report in 2018 on the state of computer science education policy in the U.S. Surprisingly, the study revealed that only 35% of public high schools in 24 states offer computer science courses. However, 33 U.S. states now offer teacher certification in computer science, up from 27 last year. “Overall, the theme of the report is very much that we’re moving in the right direction and adopting policies ... to increase participation in computer science in the K–12 space,’’ Baskin says. The increase is also trickling up, making computer science a far more popular college major. The average number of undergraduate computer science majors per department at U.S. doctoral institutions grew from 818 in 2016 to 900 in 2017, according to the Computing Research Association (CRA) annual Taulbee Survey. This has proven to be a mixed blessing, says Elizabeth Bizot, director of statistics and evaluation at the CRA. “There’s a lot of demand for students with those skills, and in that sense, increases are a good thing,’’ she says. However, the average number of CS majors per department has increased 368% from 2006 to 2017, according to Bizot, “and that puts a lot of strain on departments in terms of teaching resources, classroom space, etc., as they seek to serve students well.” The CS Teacher Shortage')","('authors', [])","('filename', '-p17-shein.pdf')","('title', '')"

There are two other categories—computingintensive fields in science and engineering where computing is a tool but is not the focus of concern, and computing-infrastructure occupations, where specialists operate and maintain the infrastructures on which everyone depends. Table 1 is an update of the original table, now showing 52 specialties. Table 1 reflects the interests of the members of ACM and IEEE-CS. However, this is not the only way to categorize computing professionals. The U.S. Bureau of Labor statistics maintains a list of “computer and information technology occupations” that spells out the kinds of jobs employers recruit W E STARTED THIS column in 2001 when ACM was re-envisioning itself as a society of a computing profession. ACM leaders and many members already thought of computing as a profession. They wanted ACM to strengthen its support of computing professionals and its commitment to the practitioners of a computing profession. How has all this progressed in the past 17 years? In my first column on the IT profession, my opening question was whether a profession is needed in the first place. I wrote: “To most of the hundreds of millions of computer users around the world, the inner workings of a computer are an utter mystery. Opening the box holds as much attraction as lifting the hood of a car. Users look to computing professionals to help them with their needs for designing, locating, retrieving, using, configuring, programming, maintaining and understanding computers, networks, applications, and digital objects.” The need has intensified over the years because there are now billions of users and the technologies they rely on are much more complex. The ACM and IEEE Computer Society are the two main professional societies in computing. They are comparable in size with approximately 100,000 members each. ACM has traditionally emphasized the science-math side of computing, and IEEE-CS the engineering-design side of computing. The two societies have cooperated on many joint ventures including curriculum recommendations and accreditation. They have diverged on certification and licensing, which traditionally have been eschewed by ACM leadership and embraced by IEEE-CS leadership. The next question was what specialties have professionals organized to deal with specific kinds of concerns— for example, specialists in programming languages, operating systems, networks, or graphics. The ACM SIGs and IEEE-CS hosted organizations to support these groups. ACM had (and still has) around 40 SIGs in specialized areas. The list of SIGs is a useful guide to the organized core specialties of computing.

Frank Rosenblatt, a neurobiologist of Cornell, invented the Perceptron, a single-layer neural net, in 1958. The New York Times reported the perceptron to be “the embryo of an electronic computer that [the Navy] expects will be able to walk, talk, see, write, reproduce itself and be conscious of its existence.” Unfortunately, the perceptron is quite limited and was proven as such in Marvin Minsky and Seymour Papert’s 1969 book, Perceptrons. The peak of hype was then followed by the trough of disillusionment. This socalled “First AI Winter” manifested, among other things, in the declining research funding for artificial intelligence, and lasted until the early 1980s. In 1982, John Hopfield of Caltech presented a paper with a focus not on modeling brains but on creating useful devices. With mathematical clarity, he showed how such networks could work and what they could do. Around the same time, a U.S.-Japan Joint Conference on Cooperative/Competitive Neural Networks was held in Kyoto, Japan. Japan subsequently announced its Fifth Generation effort. U.S. periodicals picked up that story, generating a worry that the U.S. could be left behind. Soon funding was flowing once again. The Annual Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems was launched in 1987. Yet the new peak of hype was again followed by a trough of disillusionment. Quoting again the Turing Award announcement: “By the early 2000s, LeCun, Hinton, and Bengio were among a small group who remained committed to this approach.” In fact, their efforts to rekindle the AI community’s interest in neural networks were initially met with skepticism. This disillusionment led to the “Second AI Winter,” which lasted well into the 1990s. T HE INSTITUTE FOR THE FUTURE (IFTF) in Palo Alto, CA, is a U.S.–based think tank. It was established in 1968 as a spin-off from the RAND Corporation to help organizations plan for the long-term future. Roy Amara, who passed away in 2007, was IFTF’s president from 1971 until 1990. Amara is best known for coining Amara’s Law on the effect of technology: “We tend to overestimate the effect of a technology in the short run and underestimate the effect in the long run.” This law is best illustrated by the Gartner Hype Cycle, characterized by the “peak of inflated expectations,” followed by the “trough of disillusionment,” then the “slope of enlightenment,” and, finally, the “plateau of productivity.” I was reminded of Amara’s Law when I heard that the 2018 Turing Award was awarded to Yoshua Bengio, Geoffrey Hinton, and Yann LeCun for “conceptual and engineering breakthroughs that have made deep neural networks a critical component of computing.” This decision was hardly surprising. After all, it is difficult to think of any other computing technology that has such a dramatic appearance and impact over the past decade. Quoting the Turing Award announcement: “In recent years, deeplearning methods have been responsible for astonishing breakthroughs in computer vision, speech recognition, natural language processing, and robotics—among other applications.” But it is worthwhile to reflect on the long history of neural nets in order to put this contribution in its proper historical context.

Experience and technical knowledge you will gain from the job. 4. Connections with other professionals you will make. 5.

How could I do anything without knowing everything that had already been done? Fortunately, in my first year of graduate school, I had the good luck to fall into the hands of senior physicists who insisted, over my anxious objections, that I must start doing research, and pick up what I needed to know as I went along. It was sink or swim. To my surprise, I found that this works. I managed to get a quick PhD — though when I got it I knew almost nothing about physics. But I did learn one big thing: that no one knows everything, and you don’t have to. Another lesson to be learned, to continue using my oceanographic metaphor, is that while you are swimming and not sinking you should aim for rough water. When I was teaching at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the late 1960s, a student told me that he wanted to go into general relativity rather than the area I was working on, elementary particle physics, because the principles of the former were well known, while the latter seemed like a mess to him. It struck me that he had just given a perfectly good reason for doing the opposite. Particle physics was an area where creative work could still be done. It really was a mess in the 1960s, but since that time the work of many theoretical and experimental physicists has been able to sort it out, and put everything (well, almost everything) together in a beautiful theory known as the standard model.My advice is to go for the messes — that’s where the action is. My third piece of advice is probably the hardest to take. It is to forgive yourself for wasting time. Students are only asked to solve problems that their professors (unless unusually cruel) know to be solvable. In addition,it doesn’t matter if the problems are scientifically important — they have to be solved to pass the course. But in the real world, it’s very hard to know which problems are important, and you never know whether at a given moment in history a problem is solvable. At the beginning of the twentieth century, several leading physicists, including Lorentz and Abraham, were trying to work out a theory of the electron. This was partly in order to understand why all attempts to detect effects of Earth’s motion through the ether had failed. We now know that they were working on the wrong problem. At that time, no one could have developed a successful theory of the electron, because quantum mechanics had not yet been discovered. It took the genius of Albert Einstein in 1905 to realize that the right problem on which to work was the effect of motion on measurements of space and time. This led him to the special theory of relativity. As you will never be sure which are the right problems to work on, most of the time that you spend in the laboratory or at your desk will be wasted. If you want to be creative, then you will have to get used concepts')","('authors', [{'name': 'Steven Weinberg', 'affiliations': []}])","('filename', '-Weinberg.pdf')","('title', '')"

We came to recognize that the methods that physicists were using might improve trust and integrity in many sciences, including those with high-stakes analyses that are easily plagued by bias. Many motivations distort what inferences we draw from data. These include the desire to support one’s theory, to refute one’s competitors, to be first to report a phenomenon, or simply to avoid publishing ‘odd’ been using blind analysis for measurements of supernovae that serve as a ‘cosmic yardstick’ in studies of the unexpected acceleration of the Universe’s expansion. In several subfields of particle physics and cosmology, a new sort of analytical culture is forming: blind analysis is often considered the only way to trust many results. It is also being used in some clinicaltrial protocols (the term ‘triple-blinding’ sometimes refers to this), and is increasingly used in forensic laboratories as well. But the concept is hardly known in the biological, psychological and social Decades ago, physicists including Richard Feynman noticed something worrying. New estimates of basic physical constants were often closer to published values than would be expected given standard errors of measurement. They realized that researchers were more likely to ‘confirm’ past results than refute them — results that did not conform to their expectation were more often systematically discarded or revised. To minimize this problem, teams of particle physicists and cosmologists developed methods of blind analysis: temporarily and judiciously removing data labels and altering data values to fight bias and error.

Undoubtedly, that idea of unrelenting rigor marked the life of this brilliant artist, scientist, hydraulic and military engineer. Leonardo looked for perfection and beauty with such obstinacy that it caused him great suffering and limited the number of his incredible works. We could propose a definition for rigor saying that it consists in the disciplined application of reason to subjects related to knowledge and or communication. Rigor is many things. It is dissatisfaction with uncertainty, with inaccurate answers, with unprecise measurements, with the spread between the plus and the minus. Rigor is also being methodical commitment to experimental procedure, to the need of controlling all parameters that can affect the results of our tests. But rigor is also strict adherence to the truth, it is to disrobe ourselves of our prejudices and enthusiasm when we interpret our results, it is to search for all possible explanations of what we observe, it is accepting a result that demonstrates the fallacy of our most precious hypothesis Rigor is an attitude that contrasts with the weaknesses of human nature, does not allow laziness, the lack of attention, the acceptance of inexact methods, the adoption of groundless conclusions, accepting the predominant opinion despite the lack of data which sustain it. A famous biochemist, Dr. Efraim Racker, once said “there’s nothing sadder that an ugly fact destroying a beautiful idea”. Rigor demands us to accept the destruction of that beautiful idea by facts. Rigor is in the essence of scientific work, in each one of the stages of the research work. Rigor implies a structured and controlled way of planning, developing, analyzing and evaluating our research and a special care in adapting the presentation of the results to the demands of the audience we communicate the results of our investigations. Let’s review step by step the stages of research and how rigor influences them. Investigations start with questions that we ask ourselves about the universe, human beings, and nature that surrounds us. Scientific questions are different from the ones that philosophers or theologians ask themselves due to the fact that the scientific questions can and should have experimental answers. In the formulation of question(s), the rigor is precisely in achieving precision in formulating the questions thus allowing us to imagine experiments able to answer them. It is not enough to ask ourselves ‘What causes cancer ?’ All the available information should be used to break down that big question into a series of other related questions that enable to obtain clear answers. For example ‘Why a serine 45 mutation of the beta catenine protein is frequently found in many tumours?’ When making this question, the rigorous scientist will have one hypothesis, a possible answer that can be experimentally checked and that will answer the question. For example: ‘Serine 45 of beta catenine is phosphorylated by a protein kinase”. When this phosphorylation is prevented by mutation, cellular division is stimulated and cancer results. This would be our hypothesis. Thoroughness demands us to propose a project with all the necessary experiments to answer the question using our hypothesis as a focus in order to prove it right or to demonstrate it wrong. Being rigorous in the formulation of a scientific research project implies many aspects. A key component is choosing questions and hypothesis that can be answered experimentally in the time and with the means proposed in the project. Another main aspect is the rigor in the ARTICLE PANEL')","('authors', [])","('filename', '!!Rigor – The essence of scientific work _ Allende _ Electronic Journal of Biotechnology.pdf')","('title', '')"

The adviser is never available or is too available; gives too much feedback or not enough; is too critical or isn’t providing enough direction; and so on. Exchanging horror stories with other students is a great way to bond. But advising goes both ways — and if, after careful reflection on their own studies and progress, students determine that they are not getting the guidance they require, they must address the deficiencies. It is not surprising that advisers figure large in graduate students’ conversations. In 2009, the US Council of Graduate Schools in Washington DC reported survey results showing that 65% of the 1,856 doctoral students who responded identified mentoring or advising as a main factor in PhD completion. Our own research at Flinders University in Adelaide, Australia, and our experience at graduate-student workshops across the world suggest that the adviser–student relationship has a big impact on completion time. It certainly influences whether students are still smiling at the end of their degrees! Students often assume that once they call someone an adviser, he or she automatically acquires all the skills of advising. After all, if your adviser is the world leader in stem-cell technology, he or she must excel at the seemingly simple task of advising — not to mention possess highly developed interpersonal skills and a keen interest in graduate-student development. Sadly, that is not the case. Sometimes, advising is a weakness of an otherwise very accomplished scientist. This is not surprising. Mentoring tends to be a private business, and often the only model available is an adviser’s own experience of having been advised. If it was good, they decide to copy that style and methodology; if it was bad, they do the opposite. There is no guarantee that either approach will provide the student with the guidance he or she needs. A proactive approach is necessary. If your adviser isn’t looking after you in the way you need, then you need to look after them. At some point in the PhD journey, most graduate students come to an important realization: “This is my thesis. My name is written on the front of it. I need to become the driver.” The sooner the candidate does this, the better. If you’re not getting feedback, clear direction or the necessary resources, then you must do something about it.

These reports should be collected in a central place, in a uniform format. Most conferences’ footprints will be dominated by participants’ air travel, but the data gathered should go beyond this to include ground transportation, travel to in-person program committee meetings, and estimated emissions from hotels and food. ACM should develop tools to gather and publicize this data. For example, A B R O A D S C I E N T I F I C C O N S E N S U S warns that human emissions of greenhouse gases are warming the earth. This is a present-day emergency: the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) says a 40% decrease in emissions is needed by 2030 to avoid irreversible damage. Reductions on this scale require urgent and sustained commitment at all levels of society—not only national, state, and city governments, but also universities, companies, and scientific societies. Indeed, scientific societies have an especially important role to play, since, for many members, travel to conferences represents a substantial or even dominant part of their individual contribution to climate change. A single round-trip flight from Philadelphia, PA to Paris, France typically emits the equivalent of approximately 1.8 tons of carbon dioxide (CO2e, or informally “carbon”) per passenger.14 This is a significant fraction of the total yearly emissions for an average resident of the U.S. (16.5 tons) or Europe (7 tons).

Most conferP UBLICATION IN TOP conferences is a key factor, albeit controversial, in the dissemination of ideas and career promotion in many areas of computer science. Therefore, it is a major goal for every CS researcher. However, many researchers believe publishing in a top conference is something reserved for the established members of the conference community. For newcomers, this is a tough nut to crack. Indeed, when talking with fellow researchers the assumed unspoken truth is always the same: If you are not one of “them,” you have no chance to get “in” on your own. If this were true, it would imply that senior researchers wishing to change fields during their research career may have a difficult time doing so. And the impact would be even more dramatic for junior researchers: they could only access top venues by going together with their supervisor, limiting their options to make a name for themselves—exactly the opposite of what evaluation committees typically require from candidates. Indeed, candidates are supposed to show their ability to propose and develop valid research lines independently of their supervisor, even better if it is in a slightly different research field and hence in a different community. But is it true that conferences are closed communities? Or is it just a myth spread by those that tried and failed? And if so, how do we change this situation (and do we really need to change it)?

These columns were widely read, and the feedback I received was generally quite positive, but they had zero impact on how we go about publishing our research. Conferences still provide the main vehicle for dissemination of curated computing research. What did I miss? I believe the main advantage that conferences have over journals is that of predictability. Conferences have clear dates for submission, author feedback, and notification. Journals, in general, have none of these. Such predictability is both a powerful motivating factor and a source of comfort. In spite of their flaws, conference publishing dominates because of the predictability it provides. Yet the dominance of conference publication comes at a cost. As publishing one’s paper at a prestigious conference has become the standard way to build professional credentials, expectations with respect to quality have risen. Reviewers expect papers to be of polished archival quality, and often reject papers—even ones that present innovative, interesting research—that fail to meet their standards for such quality. Rejected papers are then revised and submitted to another conference, but will be judged by another set of reviewers, with somewhat differing expectations. Good papers can bounce from conference to conference, imposing a huge cost on the research community in terms of the reviewing effort. Viewed from this perspective, the predictability of conference publishing is rather illusory. A simple remedy to this problem is for conferences to adopt a standard element of journal publishing, which is the revision. Some conferences have already adopted this practice and allow a submission cycle to include two rounds of reviewing, to enable authors to revise their papers. This practice should be adopted by all computing-research conferences, I would argue. But the much bigger issue is that a computing-research conference is “a journal that meets in a hotel.” Every paper accepted to a conference requires one or more authors to travel up to halfway around the world in order to present the paper in an oral or poster presentation. The conference publication system is, therefore, a major source of air travel. For example, over the past 20 years I have air traveled more than two million miles. I used to think of that as a professional status symbol. But as every passenger of a transocean flight contributes about 1.8 tons of CO2 to the atmosphere, it is fair to estimate that a participant in a conference contributes on the average one ton of CO2 to the atmosphere (also taking into account hotel and conference rooms air-conditioning and the like). The conference-publication system thus adds to the atmosphere annually tens of thousands of tons of CO2. As the reality of human-caused climate change is getting clearer by the day, the contribution of our profession to the approaching “climate apocalypse” cannot be ignored. My professional “badge of honor” is turning into a badge of shame, I am afraid. Of course, conferences are more than a paper-publishing system. First and foremost, they are vehicles for information sharing, community building, and networking. But these can be decoupled from research publishing, and other disciplines are able to achieve them with much less travel, usually with one major conference per year. Can we reduce the carbon footprint of computing-research publishing? While ACM has instituted the Carbon Offset Program, I believe we need to go further. I propose that ACM (and other professional computing associations) establish a sweeping policy change that would apply immediately to all its conferences, requiring that authors of accepted papers that must fly to participate in a conference may opt out from in-person involvement and contribute instead by video. This will not only reduce air travel but will also broaden participation in computing-research conferences by enabling authors with disabilities or with family constraints to partake as well. An author who elects to participate remotely should pay a reduced registration fee to cover conference expenses. Once we allow authors to attend conferences virtually, we should allow the same option to other conference participants. We will then be able to observe the value of inperson conference participation to our community. My suspicion is that it is much less valuable than we would like to believe. I believe that ACM should take a leadership role, as it did when ACM Council adopted the Policy Against Harassment at ACM Activities, in recognizing the climate emergency we face and in doing its share to reduce its environmental footprint.

When humans possess a tool, they excel at finding new uses for it. The tool often exists before the problem to be solved” [1]. I’ve come to a disconcerting conclusion: Design research is great when it comes to improving existing product categories, but essentially useless when it comes to breakthroughs. I reached this conclusion through examining a range of product innovations, most especially looking at those major conceptual breakthroughs that have had a huge impact upon society as well as the more common, mundane, small, continual improvements. Call one a conceptual breakthrough, the other incremental. Although we would prefer to believe conceptual breakthroughs occur because of a detailed consideration of human needs, especially fundamental but unspoken hidden needs so beloved by the design research community, the fact is it simply doesn’t happen. New conceptual breakthroughs are invariably driven by the development of new technologies. The new technologies, in turn, inspire technologists to invent things. Why the invention? Sometimes because the inventors themselves dream of having the capabilities, but many times simply because they can build them. In other words, grand conceptual inventions happen because technology has finally made them possible. Do people need them? That question is answered over the next several decades as technology moves from technical demonstration, to product, to failure, or perhaps to slow acceptance in the commercial world where slowly, after considerable time, the products and applications jointly evolve, and slowly the need develops. Are flush toilets, indoor plumbing, electric lighting, automobiles, airplanes, or modern telecommunication essential needs? Civilization got along quite well without them for thousands of years. Today many consider them not just needs but essentials. And every one of these was driven by technology. Revolutionary innovation is what design companies prefer, what design contests reinforce, and what most consultants love to preach. But if you examine the business impact of innovation, you will soon discover that the most frequent gains come from the small, incremental innovations—changes that lower costs, add some simple features, and smooth out the rough edges of a product. Most innovations are small, relatively simple, and fit comfortably into the established rhythm and competencies of the existing product-delivery cycle. Moreover, it is these small, incremental improvements that are best informed by design research. Successful revolutionary innovation is rare. In any given arena, it happens only a few times per decade. Why? In part because it is difficult to invent a new concept that truly fits people’s lives and needs. In part, it is because existing products already satisfy most people, and when the new concepts appear, the older, existing technologies have a remarkable way of rising to the challenge and sustaining themselves for years—decades even—long after people thought they would disappear. How long did it take the train to overtake the canal as a means of shipping goods? How long did it take the automobile to overtake the horse and carriage as a means of transportation? Think decades. Even simple innovations take decades to gain market acceptance. The path of diffusion of innovation has been well studied, well documented. Most radical innovations fail. Those that succeed can take decades before they are successful. The grand breakthrough innovation is what professors love [1] Nye, D. E. Technology Matters: Questions to Live With.

The lack of a methodology to serve as a commonly accepted framework for DS research and of a template for its presentation may have contributed to its slow adoption. The design science research methodology (DSRM) presented here incorporates principles, practices, and procedures required to carry out such research and meets three objectives: it is consistent with prior literature, it provides a nominal process model for doing DS research, and it provides a mental model for presenting and evaluating DS research in IS. The DS process includes six steps: problem identification and motivation, definition of the objectives for a solution, design and development, demonstration, evaluation, and communication. We demonstrate and evaluate the methodology by presenting four case studies in terms of the DSRM, including cases that present the design of a database to support health assessment methods, a software reuse measure, an Internet video telephony application, and an IS planning method.

Research in design has a long history in many fields including architecture, engineering, education, psychology, and the fine arts (Cross 2001). The computing and information technology (CIT) field since its advent in the late 1940s has appropriated many of the ideas, concepts, and methods of design science that have originated in these other disciplines. However, information systems (IS) as composed of inherently mutable and adaptable hardware, software, and human interfaces provide many unique and challenging design problems that call for new and creative ideas. The design science research paradigm is highly relevant to information systems (IS) research because it directly addresses two of the key issues of the discipline: the central, albeit controversial, role of the IT artifact in IS research (Weber 1987; Orlikowski and Iacono 2001; Benbasat and Zmud 2003) and the perceived lack of professional relevance of IS research (Benbasat and Zmud 1999; Hirschheim and Klein 2003). Design science, as conceptualized by Simon (1996), supports a pragmatic research paradigm that calls for the creation of innovative artifacts to solve real-world problems. Thus, design science research combines a focus on the IT artifact with a high priority on relevance in the application domain. A tradition of design science research in the IS field has been slow to coalesce. Research in IS has been dominated by studies of the impacts of IT artifacts on organizations, teams, and individuals.

While some writers express unease about the ‘whatever works’ position that underpins it (e.g. Buchanan, 1992; Pawson and Tilly, 1997), so far as research practice is concerned, combining quantitative and qualitative research has become unexceptional and unremarkable in recent years. Indeed, for some writers it has come to be seen as a distinctive research approach in its own right that warrants comparison with each of quantitative and qualitative research. In this sense, we end up with three distinct approaches to research: quantitative; qualitative; and what is variously called multi-methods (Brannen, 1992), multi-strategy (Bryman, 2004), mixed methods (Creswell, A RT I C L E 97 DOI: 10.1177/1468794106058877 Integrating quantitative and qualitative research: how is it done?

In the field of evaluation research, and indeed in several other applied fields, the case for a multi-strategy research approach seems to have acquired especially strong support (Tashakkori and Teddlie, 2003). Typologies of mixed-methods research The discussion of the integration of quantitative and qualitative research has increasingly been taken over by a formalized approach which is especially apparent in the discussion and proliferation of typologies of integration. This has been a particular emphasis among North American contributors to the field. Creswell et al. (2003) argue that giving types of mixed-methods research names has certain advantages. It conveys a sense of the rigour of the research and provides guidance to others about what researchers intend to do or have done (for example, funding bodies and journal editors). To that extent, the typologies of mixed-methods or multi-strategy research can be helpful to researchers and writers in clarifying the nature of their intentions or of their accomplishments. However, the variety and range of typologies has reached the point where these exercises have become almost too refined, bearing in mind that the range of concrete examples of multi-strategy research is not great. Indeed, most of the typologies have been constructed in largely theoretical terms and have not been apparently influenced in a systematic way by examples of multi-strategy research. To a large extent, they are exercises in logically possible types of integration, rather than being built up out of examples. However, the dimensions out of which the typologies are constructed are instructive, in that they draw attention to the different aspects of multistrategy research: 1. Are the quantitative and qualitative data collected simultaneously or sequentially? (Morgan, 1998; Morse, 1991). 2. Which has priority – the quantitative or the qualitative data? (Morgan, 1998; Morse, 1991). 3. What is the function of the integration – for example, triangulation, explanation, or exploration? (Creswell, 2003; Creswell et al., 2003; Greene et al., 1989). 4. At what stage(s) in the research process does multi-strategy research occur? (Tashakkori and Teddlie, 1998). It may be at stages of research question formulation, data collection, data analysis, or data interpretation. 5. Is there more than one data strand? (Tashakkori and Teddlie, 2003).

Ziel des NatCen war es, eine möglichst große Transparenz der Auswertung sowie eine hohe Validität der Ergebnisse qualitativer Studien zu erreichen. Besonders für angewandte oder gesundheitspolitisch bedeutsame qualitative Studien, bzw. deren Nutzer, sind diese Kriterien von hoher Bedeutung (Pope 2000). Die strukturierte Organisation der Daten sowie deren Analyse im Framework setzen an der angestrebten Nachvollziehbarkeit an und begegnen damit einer oft formulierten Kritik an qualitativer Forschung (Lamnek 2005). Die Framework Analysis erfreut sich – auch aufgrund ihrer guten Anwendbarkeit – zunehmender Beliebtheit in qualitativen Studien und im Rahmen von triangulierten oder Mixed Methods Designs (vgl. z. B. Gale et al. 2013; Ward et al. 2013). Sie hat in ihrer Systematik einige Gemeinsamkeiten mit Verfahren der Inhaltsanalyse (z. B. nach Mayring oder nach Kuckartz) und dem thematischen Kodieren (Fringer 2013) bzw. der „Thematic analysis“ (Braun & Clarke 2006; Smith & Firth 2011). Jedoch bleibt die Framework Analysis stärker im Text, d.h. den Originaldaten verankert. Begrifflich erinnert die Framework Analysis an die im deutschen Wissenschaftsraum verwendete Rahmenanalyse nach Erving Goffman (Goffman 2000), die jedoch ein soziologisches Analysekonzept von Organisationsprinzipien des Alltags darstellt. Sie kann einen festgelegten theoretischen Hintergrund für die Datenorganisation und -analyse bieten, ist jedoch als eigenständiger Ansatz von der hier vorgestellten Methode der Datenorganisation nach Framework Analysis abzugrenzen. Verschiedene Autoren verweisen so auch darauf, dass die Verwendung der Bezeichnung „Framework Approach“ irreführend sein kann, da es sich um ein Instrument für die Datenanalyse handelt und nicht um eine bestimmte „Forschungsschule“, die per se mit diversen theoretisch-philosophischen Vorannahmen verbunden ist (Ormston et al. 2014, S. 21; vgl. zu weiteren Einordnung der Framework Analysis Kap. 1).')","('authors', [{'name': 'Christine Dunger/Martin', 'affiliations': []}, {'name': 'W.

Factor analysis searches for such joint variations in response to unobserved latent variables. The observed variables are modelled as linear combinations of the potential factors, plus ""error"" terms. Factor analysis aims to find independent latent variables. The theory behind factor analytic methods is that the information gained about the interdependencies between observed variables can be used later to reduce the set of variables in a dataset. Factor analysis is commonly used in biology, psychometrics, personality theories, marketing, product management, operations research, and finance. Proponents of factor analysis believe that it helps to deal with data sets where there are large numbers of observed variables that are thought to reflect a smaller number of underlying/latent variables.

The results were “plain as day”, recalls Motyl, a psychology PhD student at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville. Data from a study of nearly 2,000 people seemed to show that political moderates saw shades of grey more accurately than did either left-wing or rightwing extremists. “The hypothesis was sexy,” he says, “and the data provided clear support.” The P value, a common index for the strength of evidence, was 0.01 — usually interpreted as ‘very significant’. Publication in a high-impact journal seemed within Motyl’s grasp. But then reality intervened. Sensitive to controversies over reproducibility, Motyl and his adviser, Brian Nosek, decided to replicate the study. With extra data, the P value came out as 0.59 — not even close to the conventional level of significance, 0.05. The effect had disappeared, and with it, Motyl’s dreams of youthful fame. It turned out that the problem was not in the data or in Motyl’s analyses. It lay in the surprisingly slippery nature of the P value, which is neither as reliable nor as objective as most scientists assume. “P values are not doing their job, because they can’t,” says Stephen Ziliak, an economist at Roosevelt University in Chicago, Illinois, and a frequent critic of the way statistics are used. For many scientists, this is especially worrying in light of the reproducibility concerns. In 2005, epidemiologist John Ioannidis of Stanford University in California suggested that most published findings are false; since then, a string of high-profile replication problems has forced scientists to rethink how they evaluate results. At the same time, statisticians are looking for better ways of thinking about data, to help scientists to avoid missing important information or acting on false alarms. “Change your statistical philosophy and all of a sudden different things become important,” says Steven Goodman, a physician and statistician at Stanford. “Then ‘laws’ handed down from God are no longer handed down from God.

This paper presents and discusses key issues in “affective computing,” computing that relates to, arises from, or influences emotions. Models are suggested for computer recognition of human emotion, and new applications are presented for computerassisted learning, perceptual information retrieval, arts and entertainment, and human health and interaction. Affective computing, coupled with new wearable computers, will also provide the ability to gather new data necessary for advances in emotion and cognition theory. 1 Fear, Emotion, and Science Nothing in life is to be feared. It is only to be understood. – Marie Curie Emotions have a stigma in science; they are believed to be inherently non-scientific. Scientific principles are derived from rational thought, logical arguments, testable hypotheses, and repeatable experiments. There is room alongside science for “non-interfering” emotions such as those involved in curiosity, frustration, and the pleasure of discovery. In fact, much scientific research has been prompted by fear. Nonetheless, the role of emotions is marginalized at best. Why bring “emotion” or “affect” into any of the deliberate tools of science? Moreover, shouldn’t it be completely avoided when considering properties to design into computers? After all, computers control significant parts of our lives – the phone system, the stock market, nuclear power plants, jet landings, and more. Who wants a computer to be able to “feel angry” at them? To feel contempt for any living thing? In this essay I will submit for discussion a set of ideas on what I call “affective computing,” computing that relates to, arises from, or influences emotions. This will need some further clarification which I shall attempt below. I should say up front that I am not proposing the pursuit of computerized cingulotomies or even into the business of building “emotional computers”. The making of small wounds in the ridge of the limbic system known as the cingulate gyrus, a surgical procedure to aid severely depressed patients. Nor will I propose answers to the difficult and intriguing questions, “what are emotions?” “what causes them?” and “why do we have them?” Instead, by a variety of short scenarios, I will define important issues in affective computing. I will suggest models for affect recognition, and present my ideas for new applications of affective computing to computer-assisted learning, perceptual information retrieval, arts and entertainment, and human health and interaction.

They have the requisite experience and knowledge to evaluate whether a study’s methods are appropriate, results are accurate, and the authors’ interpretations of the results are reasonable. Referees are expected to alert the journal editor to any problems they identify, and make recommendations as to whether a paper should be accepted, returned to the authors for revisions, or rejected. Referees are not expected to replicate results or (necessarily) to be able to identify deliberate fraud.

As a step toward preventing this species from becoming endangered, this report identifies the Black-Bellied Plover habitat in Louisiana. To identify the habitat, I examined information about Black-Bellied Plover sightings in Louisiana over the last 50 years and the landuse categories derived from satellite imagery of the sighting locations. These examinations indicate that the Black-Bellied Plover habitat in Louisiana is generally pasture and shrubland. To protect this species, the Louisiana Department of Parks and Wildlife or the private sector should conserve and monitor this habitat, especially in the areas where the most frequent sightings have occurred on Grand Isle and around Caillou Bay.

Generally, the introduction provides necessary background information to your study and provides readers with some sense of your overall research interest. A good introduction should: \uf0a7 Establish the general territory (real world or research) in which the research is placed. \uf0a7 Describe the broad foundations of your study, including some references to existing literature and/or empirically observable situations. In other words, the introduction needs to provide sufficient background for readers to understand where your study is coming from. \uf0a7 Indicate the general scope of your project, but do not go into so much detail that later sections (purpose/literature review) become irrelevant. \uf0a7 Provide an overview of the sections that will appear in your proposal (optional). \uf0a7 Engage the readers.

In the 1950s vermin provided justification for housing and health agencies to pursue urban renewal, and also gave tenant activists a striking symbol of officials’ neglect of their neighborhoods. Today, though we know that vermin produce indoor allergens, and we have pesticides designed to keep vermin at bay, the fact that both may be hazardous confuses parents, health officials, and other advocates who seek to protect health. As long as people have lived in cities, pest animals have joined us in our homes and buildings, affected our health, and propelled our policies on the urban environment.

Disappointment sets in, however, when bugs are found and features don’t work as expected. Under great stress and with great turmoil, an emergency release is produced and put into production (hurried through the regular release process, often achieved by skipping tests), which has still more bugs, and the process repeats with more emergency releases, leading to more frustration, stress, and disappointment.

P E R K I N S A VARIETY OF Internet online services are designed based on contests. A canonical example is crowdsourcing services, which solicit solutions to tasks by open calls to online communities. Here the tasks can be of different categories, such as art design, software development, data-science problems, and various challenges such as planetary-scale locating of objects. These services operate under certain contest rules that include specifying a prize allocation mechanism, for example, awarding only a first-place prize or several position prizes. The prizes can be monetary, or in-kind rewards such as in terms of attention, status, or computing resources, for example, CPU, bandwidth, and storage. We refer to a contest as any situation in which agents invest irreversible and costly efforts toward winning a prize, which is allocated based on relative performance. We use the term “contest theory” in a broad sense to refer to a set of theories developed for the better understanding and informed design of contests. A central question in contest theory is: How to allocate prizes to maximize a desired objective? The objective may be to maximize the utility of production to the agent who solicits solutions to a task, or to the whole society. The question of how to allocate prizes was studied as early as 1902 by Galton. A study of how to allocate prizes necessitates to consider the incentives of contestants, who act strategically in investing costly production efforts. Game theory models of contests have been studied in auction theory, economic theory, operations research, as well as theoretical biology; for example, Bishop and Smith. The use of compensation schemes based on an individual’s ordinal rank rather than absolute performance in firms have been studied by economists; for example, Lazear and Rosen. Game theory and pertinent computational questions have been studied by computer scientists. Several new contributions have been made on optimal allocation of prizes in crowdsourcing contests, equilibrium outcomes in games that model simultaneous contests, and the worst-case efficiency of production in equilibrium outcomes of various games that model contests. The skill-rating methods that use observations of relative performance comparisons as input, such as ranking outcomes in contests, have been studied extensively in the past. They are now widely used in various applications, such as sport competitions, online gaming, and online labor platforms.

Models created by machine-learning algorithms for problems such as spam filtering, speech and image recognition, language translation, and text understanding have many advantages over code written by human developers. Machine learning, however, is not as magical as it sounds at first. In fact, it is rather analogous to how human developers create code using test-driven development. Given a training set of inputoutput pairs {(a,b)|a ∈ A, b∈B}, guess a function f ∈ A → B that passes all the given tests but also generalizes to unspecified input values. A big difference between human-written code and learned models is that the latter are usually not represented by text and hence are not understandable by human developers or manipulable by existing tools. The consequence is that none of the traditional software engineering techniques for conventional programs such as code reviews, source control, and debugging are applicable anymore.

This connection between computers and mathematics was later used to develop a mathematical foundation for computer science, comparable to mathematical foundations for physics and other sciences. This column shows that Turing machines are inappropriate as a universal foundation for computational problem solving, and that computer science is a fundamentally non-mathematical discipline. Though interaction is not the only way to extend computation beyond Turing machines, we show that Turing, Milner, and others have used interaction for this purpose. Born in 1912, Turing was accepted by Cambridge University in 1930 to study mathematics, and became a Fellow of Kings College in 1934 at the age of 22, completing a dissertation that extended the group theory models of Von Neumann. His 1936 paper, On Computable Numbers with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem, proved that mathematics could not be completely modeled by computers. In the early 1940s he developed a computer model of German cipher code that helped the Allies win World War II. In the late 1940s he developed computational models of artificial intelligence, chess, and the human mind, suggesting that computers could completely model human thought and would play chess better than humans before the end of the century. Although the 1936 paper was primarily about the inability of Turing machines to solve mathematical problems, Turing machines were adopted by theoretical computer scientists in the 1960s as a mode of solving all problems of computing. Here we examine the historical evolution of Turing’s model from mathematical weakness in the 1930s to computational strength in the 1960s, and then to computational weakness in the 1990s as increases in the applicability of computation broadened our notion of “computational problem” and revealed the limitations of the power of Turing machines to handle problem solving.')","('authors', [{'name': 'Peter Wegner', 'affiliations': []}, {'name': 'Dina Goldin', 'affiliations': []}])","('filename', '-p100-wegner.pdf')","('title', '')"

Own the world. Companies are judged not by how many jobs they create, but by how many jobs they end; those are the ones that are celebrated. It is very divisive. At the core of this, of course, is money. By investing money in these companies, people try to make more money for themselves, and ultimately that is the end goal for all these things: infinite growth for the desire of infinite riches.

We can make better, faster decisions from that digitized information than is possible with traditional means” Early adopters of SenSat’s mapping technology come from the roadconstruction industry, a sector that today mainly relies on manual surveys conducted at ground level. Surveys can take as long as six weeks and, as a result, can only be performed infrequently during a project. A pillar built a foot out of place that is only discovered at a relatively late stage can set the project back weeks, but by sending out small, lightweight drones as flying cameras to scan the site on a daily basis, project managers can spot mistakes in the three-dimensional (3D) map long before they become a costly issue. Regulations currently limit the area that drones can cover, which suits focused construction projects such as bridges over freeways and intersections. However, larger-scale applications, such as a proposed expansion of the capacity of one of the U.K.’s busiest roads—the M4 motorway—will require surveys to be conducted over many miles and months. “Today, you have to keep the drone within the line of sight of the operator; that limits you to coverage of around 1km per hour. For economical use, you really want 20km2 per hour,” Dean says. Still, the U.K. government is beginning to look favorably on changes to regulations that would give survey drones greater autonomy to support projects such as the M4 expansion, he says. “At the moment, it’s a supportive environment. We think it will only get better from here.” Users of these roads, as vehicles become more autonomous, will need similarly detailed mapping to be carried out on a near-real-time basis. Although an autonomous vehicle could scan only its surroundings to see where it can drive, practical systems will use HD maps to perform the task of localization. “Using the map, we figure out where we are on the road,” says JenHsun Huang, cofounder and CEO of graphics-processor company nVidia. “We want to test whether our understanding of the world is consistent with what is around the car.” Filipe Mutz, associate professor of information systems at Federal University of Espírito Santo (IFES) in Vitória, Brazil, says the level of detail required in the map depends on its intended use: “For feature-based localization systems, a map can be represented by a sparse set of features, and it is not Digitizing the World')","('authors', [])","('filename', '-p15-edwards.pdf')","('title', '')"

Independent of their use as brain models, they are being investigated as prototypes of new computer architectures (26, 27) and as models for psychological phenomena (28-30). Some of the lessons learned from these models can be applied to the brain. One of the best studied models is the class of layered feed-forward networks. In this architecture, information is coded as a pattern of activity in an input layer of model neurons and is transformed by successive layers receiving converging synaptic inputs from preceding layers. The following three findings are of significance for the brain. (i) Even systems with only a few intermediate layers have enormous power in representing complex nonlinear fiu~ctions (31, 32). (ii) The performance of a network in specific problem domains (such as visual and speech processing) depends critically on how the incoming information is represented by the neurons (such as the type of preprocessing) and the symmetries in the pattern of connections. (iii) For difficult problems, the processing units in the middle or ""hidden"" layers generally encode many different combinations of input variables by the use of a semidistributed type of representation (33). By combining the power of these models with further constraints from neurophysiology and neuroanatomy it may be possible to interpret some of the properties that have been observed from single-unit recordings, as we illustrate in the next section (34-36). These simplifying brain models also make an important bridge to computer science and other disciplines that study information processing. Issues such as convergence of the network to a stable solution, the amoullt of time needed for the network to achieve a solution, and the capacity of networks to store information are being investigated in simplifying models in ways that are not at present feasible with realistic models (37). The scaling of these properties with the s i x of the network is crucially important for practical applications and for the plausibility of the model as a brain model (38-39). Many of the current nlodels do not scale well without additional constraints on the architecture, such as restricting the connectivity to local neighborhoods. Technology fov bvain modeling. Computational brain models are almost always simulated on digital computers. Computers are getting faster, but they must perform the many parallel operations of the brain one at a time and are many orders of magnitude too slow. Parallel computers with thousands of processors are being developed, but are still inadequate (40). A new approach toward simulating biological circuitry is being pioneered by Mead (20), who is constructing hardware devices that have components that directly mimic the circuits in the brain. Fast hardware can deliver the computing power necessary to evaluate the performance of a model in real time. Furthermore, the physical restrictions on the density of wires and the cost of communications imposed by the spatial layout of the electronic circuits are similar to the constraints imposed on biological circuits. This approach may lead to a ""synthetic neurobiology"" (20). Mead uses analog subthreshold complementary metal oxide semiconductor VLSI (very large scale integrated) circuit technology. Several chips that implement simplifying models of visual information processing have already been produced that are highly efficient. A ""retina"" chip computes the spatial and temporal derivative of arbitrary images projected onto an hexagonal array of 48 by 48 phototransistors, which are approximately logarithmic over five orders of magnitude of light amplitude, coupled by means of a horizontal resistive grid and injecting current into model ""amacrine"" cells that compute a temporal derivative (41). Similar circuits can be designed for computing optical flow in real time (42-43). 9 SEPTEMBER 1988 These VLSI chips and new techniques in optical information processing may lead to a new computing technology, sometimes called artificial neural systems, or neurocomputing (44, 45). This technology for performing massively parallel computations could have a major influence on the next generation of research in computational neuroscience. For example, an analog VLSI model of a neuron that included conductance mechanisms, synaptic apparatus, and dendritic geometry could be produced in great quantities. These chips could be used as coprocessors in a conventional digital computer to greatly increase the speed of realistic simulations. If this technology is developed now, it should be possible to simulate our visual system in real time by the 21st century (40). Specific Examples of Brain Models We will discuss several different models that show the great variety of different levels of structure, analysis, and measurement existing in contemporary computational neuroscience. It is impossible to discuss in this article even a small fraction of the models in the literature that address a particular problem in neurobiology, so we will limit ourselves to a few examples from the invertebrate and vertebrate vision literature. This choice reflects the idiosyncrasies and research interests of the authors and in no way implies that other areas within neurobiology have not developed equally relevant models (46). The modeling of learning and memory is an important area not covered here. Evidence for neural plasticity is accumulating at the cellular and molecular levels in a variety of systenls (47-51). The conditions for plasticity can be incorporated onto large-scale network models that have properties that can be explored in simulations of realistic models (46, 52, 53) and analytically for simplifying models (54, 57). A separate review would be required to summarize all the interesting models of learning and memory in brain circuits that are now being explored (58-60). Detecting and computing motion. Visual motion is a fundamental source of information about the world (61, 62), and motion detection is the first stage of motion processing. Keichardt\'s motion detection scheme was first proposed 30 years ago. Behavioral data, gained on the basis of openand closed-loop experimects performed on beetles and flies (63, 64), indicated that a sequence of two light stimuli impinging on adjacent photoreceptors is the elementary event evoking an optomotor response. The relation between stimulus input to these two photoreceptors and the strength of the optomotor output follows the rule of algebraic sign multiplication (65, 66). The correlation model of motion detection follows from these observations (63). The output of one photoreceptor is multiplied by a low-pass filtered signal from a neighboring receptor (Fig. 1A). The product is then integrated in time, which is equivalent to the autocorrelation of the visual input (67). Since the low-pass filter can be thought of as a delay, this direction-selective submit (Fig. 1A) will respond with a positive signal in one direction and with a negative response in the opposite direction. This theoretical model has a number of nontrivial properties, such as phase invariance and dependence on contrast frequency (67), that have been confirmed experimentally. In humans, the psychophysical evidence favors a slight modification of the original correlation model (68, 69). Thus, the correlation model for motion detection is consistent with psycl~ophysics in several different species. It is a realistic model at the systems level. Motion detection has also been explored at the cellular level. Barlow and Levick (70) systematically studied the rabbit retina by recording extracellularly from the output cells of the retina.

The effectiveness and increasing use of this tactic, highlighted in the 2016 US presidential election, justifies increased attention. An earlier Computer column1 encouraged such attention, and we elaborate here. Disinformation and misinformation both involve the distribution of false information, but with differing objectives. Disinformation involves the intentional planting of false information to conceal truth or deceive the audience, especially by state actors, whereas misinformation is more generic and relaxed regarding intention, concealment, and source. For our purposes, we intend the definition of disinformation to include not just governments but also political groups, ideological movements, and other social entities. Disinformation is more pernicious, being necessarily both intentional and deceptive in its pursuit of social engineering goals. Although some trolling might be without willful deception (as in the case of mistaken “true believers”), disinformation is the more natural ally of trolling and is thus our focus. The topic of disinformation is both complex and varied: it’s complex owing to its convoluted methods; it’s varied because of its different practitioners and contexts. It can be used to enlist support, confuse, de-legitimize, defame, intimidate, confound, escape detection or blame, avoid prosecution, and on and on. The public relations strategist uses disinformation in different ways than the tyrant owing to the latter’s assumed greater imperviousness to punishment or retribution.

All of the agent’s responses are approved by health professionals in advance. Natural language exchanges would be too risky in a healthcare environment, according to Bickmore. Instead, participants in the studies typically interact with the virtual agent through an iPad or some other large touchscreen device, and the conversation follows a narrative tree. The virtual agent asks a question or delivers a spoken prompt. The participant selects a response from a multiple-choice list. The conversation moves on. The USC platform, SimSensei, monitors pauses in conversations and tracks changes in tone, gaze aversion, and other social cues. SimSensei then processes all these indicators and autonomously determines the appropriate response. This is a risky interaction, Lucas explains. “What if the system told you O N SCREEN, THE virtual character sits in a comfortable purple chair. She wears plain pants, a turquoise shirt, and a slim jacket with the sleeves rolled up past her elbows. Her short dark hair is swept to one side and her ethnicity is intentionally ambiguous, according to her developers, a team of researchers with the University of Southern California (USC) Institute for Creative Technologies. Some of the people who have interacted with her assume she is Asian; others conclude she has a completely different ethnicity. “People have come up and said that they’re so thankful we paired them with someone of their race because it helped them connect,” recalls Gale Lucas, a research assistant professor at USC. The platform, SimSensei, is designed for one-on-one sessions with individuals, and uses visual and audio feedback to tailor its responses. In one study, veterans who submitted to counseling sessions with SimSensei shared personal and mental health concerns they would have withheld from actual human therapists. The system is designed to encourage this kind of open interaction, engaging in active listening by offering affirming or comforting responses or noting when the subject pauses or hesitates—and asking why. Human therapists carry out these techniques intuitively, yet Lucas and her colleagues found the participants were still more open with the virtual platform. Northeastern University computer scientist Timothy Bickmore and his team have found similarly surprising connections between people and virtual agents across numerous studies. Typically, Bickmore and his team will try to simulate a counseling or information-sharing session between a patient and a healthcare professional, then measure the effectiveness of virtual agents against their human counterparts. “We try to simulate face-to-face counseling,” Bickmore explains. “We have found over the years that many disadvantaged groups prefer and do much better with agents and robots compared to those with high-level tech literacy. They can get the information better. The people don’t feel they’re being talked down to.” As robots become an increasingly present and powerful force in our lives, from healthcare to home maintenance to the workplace, researchers are hard at work exploring different ways to strengthen the bonds between people and both virtual and physical agents. Some of the lessons learned in developing virtual platforms apply to embodied robots; in other cases, the rules appear to be different. What has become clear, researchers say, is that there is no simple recipe for developing likable robots.')","('authors', [])","('filename', '-p20-mone.pdf')","('title', '')"
